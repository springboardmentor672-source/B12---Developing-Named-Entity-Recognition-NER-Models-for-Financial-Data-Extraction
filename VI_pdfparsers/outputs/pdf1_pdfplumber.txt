ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a sophisticated, Internet of Things(IoT) enabled safety system specifically
designed to enhance the security and well-being of women. The system integrates multiple
biometric sensors, including electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate monitors, to facilitate
real-time physiological monitoring and automatic distress detection. In critical situations
whether identified through sensor thresholds or activated manually via a dedicated panic switch
the system promptly transmits alert messages and precise GPS location data to predefined
emergency contacts using GSM communication. A distinctive feature of the device is the
incorporation of a taser mechanism, enabling immediate self-defense in threatening scenarios.
Built on the Arduino UNO platform, the system also supports remote oversight through an IoT
interface, ensuring continuous monitoring and data logging. Emphasizing data security, user
privacy, and regulatory compliance, the proposed solution represents a comprehensive,
technologically advanced approach to personal safety, aiming to empower women and respond
effectively to real-time emergencies.
