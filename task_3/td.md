Tata Industries Limited ('TIL ' / 'the Company') is registered with the Reserve Bank of India as a Core Investment Company. The Company is an investment holding company and is part of the promoter group with shareholding in Group companies apart from being engaged in incubation / promotion of new business ventures.

As on March 31, 2024, the Company has 3 subsidiaries and the Company together with its divisions, subsidiaries and a joint venture entity are engaged in diversified businesses including Strategy  and  Management  Consulting,  Data  Analytics,  Healthcare  Diagnostics,  Education Technology, Healthsciences and Biosciences.

More than 90% of the net assets of the Company are in the form of investments in various Tata companies.  The  primary  source  of  inflow  is  dividends  received  from  Tata  companies, occasionally supplemented by sale of investments.

## Business Highlights

The Company's investing strategy is driven by assessments of technology developments that create business opportunities in areas ranging from Edtech to Healthcare.

The Company continues to make investments in existing businesses to enable them to capitalize on growth opportunities.

In Strategy &amp; Management Consulting, the Company sees strong opportunity to serve clients more deeply and to improve functional excellence, as well as facilitate ongoing transformations. There could be risks relating to retention of the high-quality talent which is relied on by the business, due to competitive intensity. Changes in the business environment could lead to deferment of projects by clients.

In Data Analytics, the Company sees opportunities in growing digitization and increasing value creation that analytics can generate in key sectors, apart from new regulations requiring better data governance. Possible risks include data sensitivity with the threat of cyber-attacks, and retention of talent in a rapidly growing data-centric environment.

The Company's Management and Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone  financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  and  are  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management and Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  standalone  financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair presentation.

We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the Balance Sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.
- (xx) Basis the requirements as stipulated by the provisions of Section 135, the Company does not  have  adequate  net  profits,  which  requires  any  CSR  spents  to  be  undertaken. Accordingly, clauses 3(xx)(a) and 3(xx)(b) of the Order are not applicable.

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act')

We have audited the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting of Tata Industries Limited (the 'Company') as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

The Company's management and the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal Financial Controls based on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities  include  the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.

## ANNEXURE 'B' TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

## Meaning of Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial  Reporting  with  reference  to standalone financial statements

A Company's Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  the  internal  financial  controls  with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  standalone  financial  statements  may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements and such Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'Guidance Note').

From April 2012 onwards, TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company ('CIC') by the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') on account of its investments being made prominently in other Tata companies. Earlier, it was registered with RBI as a Non-Banking Financial Company.

Besides carrying  out  investment  activities  from  Head  office,  TIL  has  three  operating divisions engaged into management consultancy, data analytics business and healthcare solutions.

The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 and authorised for issue on 29 April 2024.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements

## A. Statement of compliance

These Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the  Act)  read  with  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules  as amended from time to time, other relevant provisions of the Act and the Prudential norms directions  issued  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  as  applicable  to  Core Investment Companies.

## B. Functional and presentation currency

These Standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is also Company's functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest lakhs, unless otherwise indicated.

## C. Basis of preparation

The standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  Historical  cost  is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements (Continued)

## D. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation  of  standalone  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS standalone  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are  recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the estimate is revised and future periods affected.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

## (i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, considering the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers' warranties and maintenance support. Assumptions are also made, when the Company assesses whether an asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.

## (ii) Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations

The  obligation  arising  from  defined  benefit  plan  and  other  long-term employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined by  reference  to  market  yields  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  on government  bonds.  The  period  to  maturity  of  the  underlying  bonds correspond  to  the  probable  maturity  of  the  post-employment  benefit obligations.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements (Continued)

## (iii) Recognition of deferred tax assets

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits.

The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change.

## (iv) Revenue recognition

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its  fixed-price  contracts.  Use  of  the  percentage-of  completion  method requires the Company to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.

Provisions  for  estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date.

## (v) Impairment of trade receivables

The Company reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular intervals.  The  Company's  credit  risk  is  primarily  attributable  to  its  trade receivables. In determining whether impairment losses should be reported in the statement of profit and loss, the Company makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, an allowance for expected credit  loss  is  made  where  there  is  an  identified  loss  event  or condition which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.

## (vi) Impairment losses on investments

The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised cost annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements (Continued)

## E. Measurement of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

The  Company  has  an  established  control  framework  with  respect  to  the measurement of fair values, which includes overseeing all significant fair value measurement, including Level 3 fair values by the management. The management regularly  reviews  significant  unobservable  inputs  and  valuation  adjustments.  If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.

When measuring the fair  value  of  a  financial  asset  or  a  financial  liability,  the Company uses observable market  data  as  far  as  possible.  Fair  values  are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level  1  :  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or liabilities.

Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for  the  asset  or  liability,  either  directly  (i.e.  as  prices)  or  indirectly  (i.e.  derived from prices).

Level 3 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

## 3. Material accounting policies

## A. Foreign currency translation

On initial  recognition,  all  foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates  prevailing  on  the  date  of  the transaction. As at the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

- B. Financial instruments
2. (i) Investments and other financial assets

## Classification

The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- i) those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income ('OCI'), or through profit and loss), and
2. ii) those measured at amortised cost

The  classification  depends  on  the  entity's  business  model  for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in statement of profit and loss or OCI. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investment in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through OCI.

The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

## Debt instruments

At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit  or  loss,  transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments:

## Amortised cost

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)
- B. Financial instruments (Continued)
3. (i) Investments and other financial assets (Continued)

## Fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI')

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI').

Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in Statement of  Profit  and  Loss.  When  the  financial  asset  is  derecognised,  the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ (losses) within other income or other expense. Interest income from these financial assets  is  included  in  other  income  using  the  effective  interest  rate method.

## Fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL ')

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/(losses) within other income or other  expense  in  the  period  in  which  it  arises.  Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.

## Equity instruments

The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Company's management has elected to present fair value  gains  and  losses  on  equity  investments  in  OCI,  there  is  no subsequent  reclassification  of  fair  value  gains  and  losses  to  the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Other Income when the Company's right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as gains/ (losses) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and reversal  of  impairment  losses)  on  equity  investments  measured  at FVTOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

3. (i) Investments and other financial assets (Continued)

## Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of  three  months  or  less  from  the  date  of  purchase,  to  be  cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

## De-recognition of financial assets

A financial asset is derecognised only when the Company

- has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset; or
- retains  the  contractual  rights  to  receive  the  cash  flows  of  the financial assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the Company transfers an asset, it evaluates whether it has transferred  substantially  all  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the financial asset. Where the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the Company has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the Company has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset.

Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.

## (ii) Debt and equity instruments (liabilities)

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.  Equity  instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## B. Financial instruments (Continued)

## (iii) Financial liabilities

The Company's financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and other liabilities. These are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.

Changes to  the  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  liability  as  a  result  of renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of the financial liability, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## De-recognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, its obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

## (iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency  exposures.  Derivative  instruments  are  initially  measured  at  fair value.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  derivatives  are  measured  at  fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss.

The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. At inception of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  documents  the  risk management objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge.  The Company also documents the economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

## Cash Flow Hedge

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective  portion  of  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivatives  is

## (iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (Continued)

recognised in  OCI  and  accumulated  in  the  other  equity  under  'effective portion of cash flow hedges'. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge item, determined on a present value basis, from the inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss.

The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When the hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.

If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that  have  been  accumulated  in  other  equity  are  immediately reclassified in profit and loss.

## (v) Financial guarantee contracts

The  Company on a case to  case  basis  elects  to  account  for  financial guarantee contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract, as  specified  in  Ind  AS  109  on  Financial  Instruments  and  Ind  AS  104  on Insurance Contracts. The Company has regarded all its financial guarantee contracts as insurance contracts. At the end of each reporting period the Company performs a liability adequacy test, (i.e. it assesses the likelihood of a pay-out based on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows), and any deficiency is recognized in profit or loss.

## (vi) Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a legally  enforceable  right  (not  contingent  on  future  events)  to  off-set  the recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## C. Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

All  items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment are stated at their historical cost of acquisition  or  construction  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment  losses  if  any.  Historical  cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as  a  separate  asset  is  derecognised  when  replaced.  All  other  repairs  and maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the  item  to  working  condition  for  its  intended  use,  and  estimated  costs  of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Any  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is recognised in profit or loss.

Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress account. At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Depreciation  on  tangible  fixed  assets  of  the  Company  has  been  provided  on Straight  Line  Method  (SLM),  considering  the  useful  lives  and  residual  value prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the following  categories  of  assets,  in  whose  case  the  life  of  the  assets  has  been assessed as under based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support:

## D. Intangible assets

## Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets are measured at historical cost. All the intangible assets have a  finite  useful  life  and  are  subsequently  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any.

## Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life on straight line basis as follows:

| Assets                | Amortization    |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Licenses and software | One - Ten years |

## Research and development expenses

Revenue expenses pertaining to research is charged to the standalone statement of profit and loss. Development cost of products are also charged to standalone statement  of  profit  and  loss  unless  a  product's  technical  feasibility  has  been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. The amount capitalized comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended use. Property, plant and equipment utilized for research and development are  capitalized  and  depreciated  in  accordance  with  the  policies  stated  for  the property, plant and equipment.

## E. Investment property

## Recognition and measurement

Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## E. Investment property (Continued)

in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

## Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

## Depreciation

Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes a  period  of  60  years  representing  the  best  estimate  of  the  period  over  which investment property (which is quite similar) is expected to be used. Accordingly, the  company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a straight-line basis.

## Reclassification from / to investment property

Transfers to (or from) investment property are made only when there is a change in  use.  Transfers  between  investment  property,  owner-occupied  property  and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and they  do  not  change  the  cost  of  that  property  for  measurement  or  disclosure purposes.

## Fair value disclosure

The fair  values  of  investment  property  is  disclosed  in  the  notes.  Fair  values  is determined  by  an  independent  valuer  who  holds  a  recognised  and  relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## F. Inventories

Stock-in-trade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of traded goods is determined on First-in-First out (FIFO) basis and includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The comparison of cost and net realizable value  is  made  on  an  item  by  item  basis.  Provision  is  made  for  the  cost  of obsolescence and other anticipated losses, whenever considered necessary.

## G. Impairment

## Impairment of financial instruments (other than at fair value)

The  Company assesses on a forward-looking basis  the  expected  credit  loss associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

## Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment is recognised. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is  indication  that  an  impairment  loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## H. Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale

Non-current  assets,  or  disposal  groups  comprising  assets  and  liabilities  are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## H. Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale (Continued)

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resultant loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, and biological assets, which continue to  be  measured in  accordance with the Company's other accounting policies. Losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated.

## I. Employee benefits

## Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are  classified  as  short-term  employee  benefits.  These  benefits  include compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised during the year.

## Defined Contribution plans

The  Company makes monthly contributions to  the  Superannuation  fund  and National  pension  scheme  for  all  qualifying  employees,  until  retirement  or resignation of the employee. The Company recognizes such contributions as an expense when incurred. The Company has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.

## Defined benefit plans

The Company operates the post-employment schemes such as Gratuity, Provident fund and post-retirement medical benefits (PRMB) and Pension to an ex-director which are defined benefit plans.

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## I. Employee benefits (Continued)

The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method. This  approach  determines  the  present  value  of  the  interest  rate  guarantee  to employees. Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans, since the Company is obliged to meet interest shortfall,  if  any,  with  respect  to  covered employees.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising  from  experience  adjustments  and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in the other comprehensive income.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service cost.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services. They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurement as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement of profit and loss.

The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

## J. Revenue recognition

The Company has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is to be recognised.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in exchange for those products or services.

The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:

- Step 1 : Identify the contract(s) with a customer
- Step 2 : Identify the performance obligation in contract
- Step 3 : Determine the transaction price
- Step 4 : Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
- Step 5 : Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

Under Ind AS 115, an entity  recognises  revenue  when  (or  as)  a  performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when 'control' of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

In respect of contracts, revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the related services are performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue. Revenue from fixed-price, fixed-time frame contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time  and  where  there  is  no  uncertainty  as  to  measurement  or  collectability  of consideration, is recognized as per the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or  costs  expended  have  been  used  to  measure  progress  towards  completion. Projected  losses,  if  any,  are  provided  in  entirety  as  per  Ind  AS  based  on management's current estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of technical  assessment  of  time  and  effort  required  and  estimates  of  future expenditure.

## J. Revenue recognition (Continued)

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets (which are referred to  as  unbilled  revenue)  while  invoicing  in  excess  of  revenues  are  classified  as contract liabilities (which are referred to as unearned revenues).

Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue ('contract liability') is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

## Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns (if any), trade discounts, rebates, and goods and service tax.

Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract. Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of the customer contract, except in case where the amortisation period is one year or less, in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred.

## Interest income

Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instruments (for example, prepayment, extension) but does not consider the expected credit loss.

## Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Company's right to receive payment is established.

## K. Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## Company as a lessee

The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately  from  non-lease  components  of  the  contract  and  allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

The  Company recognises right-of-use  asset  representing  its  right  to  use  the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at  cost  less  any  accumulated  depreciation,  accumulated  impairment  losses,  if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,  plant  and  equipment.  Right-of-use  assets  are  tested  for  impairment whenever  there  is  any  indication  that  their  carrying  amounts  may  not  be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The  Company measures the lease liability  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the  Company,  on  a  lease  by  lease  basis,  may  adopt  either  the  incremental borrowing rate  specific  to  the  lease  or  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  for  the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## K. Leases (Continued)

The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease  payments  made  and  remeasuring  the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.

The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the rightof-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to shortterm leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for  which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is  a  short  term  lease  to  which  the  Company  applies  the  exemption  described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Company has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April  1,  2019  and  applied  the  standard  to  its  leases,  retrospectively,  with  the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard, recognised on the date of initial application (April 1, 2019).

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## K. Leases (Continued)

Accordingly, the Company has not restated comparative information, instead, the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as on April 1, 2019. The company has applied the Covid -19 related concession - amendment to Ind AS 116. The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and will affect the current &amp; future periods only.

## L. Income Tax

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates  to  a  business  combination  or  to  an  item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

## Current tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is also recognised in  respect  of  carried  forward  tax  losses  and  tax  credits.  Deferred  tax  is  not recognised for:

- temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
- a. temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint  arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

## L. Income Tax (Continued)

- b. taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Company recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realised. Deferred tax assets- unrecognised or recognised, are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. Acquired deferred tax  benefits  recognised  within  the  measurement  period  reduce  goodwill related to that acquisition if they result from new information obtained about facts  and  circumstances  existing  at  the  acquisition  date.  If  the  carrying amount  of  goodwill  is  zero,  any  remaining  deferred  tax  benefits  are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain  purchase  gains.  All  other  acquired  tax  benefits  realised  are recognised in profit or loss.

## M. Discontinued Operations

A  discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the  Company's  business,  the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Company and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and

- a. is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
- b. is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.

Classification  as  a  discontinued  operation  occurs  upon  disposal  or  when  the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.

When an operation is classified  as  a  discontinued  operation,  the  comparative statement  of  profit  and  loss  is  re-presented  as  if  the  operation  had  been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

## N. Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are  interest  and  other  costs  (including  exchange  differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable  to  acquisition  or  construction  of  an  asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

## O. Operating Segments

An operating Segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relates to transactions with any of Company's other components, and for which discrete financial information is available. All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Company's Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their performance.

## P. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable  to  equity  shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

## Q. Business combinations

## Business combinations under common control

Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted in accordance with 'Pooling of Interest Method' laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 (Ind AS 103) Business combinations of entities  under  common control ,  notified  under  the  Companies Act, 2013.

All assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books of  account  of  the  Company  at  their  existing  carrying  amounts.  Inter-company balances are eliminated.  The  difference,  between  the  investments  held  by  the Company and all assets,  liabilities  and  reserves  of  the  combining  entity  are recognised in capital reserve and presented separately from other capital reserves. Comparative  accounting  period  presented  in  the  financial  statements  of  the Company has been restated for the accounting impact of the merger, as stated above, as if the merger had occurred from the beginning of the comparative period in the financial statements.

Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets. This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis.

## Business combinations not under common control

Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in  the  acquiree  at  fair  value  or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable.

When the Company acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance

## NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## Q. Business combinations (Continued)

with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest  held,  over  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred,  the  Company  re-assesses  whether  it  has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is  recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is  no  clear  evidence  of  bargain  purchase,  the  entity  recognises  the  gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are  adjusted  through  goodwill  during  the  measurement  period,  or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. These adjustments are called as measurement period adjustments. The measurement period does not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

After  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a  business  combination  is,  from  the  acquisition  date,  allocated  to  each  of  the

## Q. Business combinations (Continued)

Company's  cash-generating  units  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually,  or  more  frequently  when  there  is  an  indication  that  the  unit  may  be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying  amount,  the  impairment  loss  is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit  and  part  of  the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative  values  of  the  disposed  operation  and  the  portion  of  the cash-generating unit retained.

## R. Provisions and contingencies

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation. Provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows (representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating losses are not provided for.

A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before such a provision is made, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## R. Provisions and contingencies (Continued)

Contingent liabilities  are  disclosed  when  there  is  a  possible  obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.

Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

## S. Recent Pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 31st March 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the company.

(Currency: Indian rupees in lakhs)

## 38 Employee benefits (Continued)

## b) Defined benefit plans (Continued)

## Actuarial assumptions: (Continued)

## Notes:

- a) Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the Balance Sheet date for the estimated term of the obligations.

## B. Measurement of fair values

The  following  table  provides  an  analysis  of  financial  instruments  that  are  measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:

## Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares.

## Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes derivative contracts.

## Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole  or  in  part,  using  a  valuation  model  based  on  assumptions  that  are  neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This level of hierarchy includes investments in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.

## C. Valuation technique to determine fair value

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments:

- (i) Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables,  loans  (measured  at  amortised  cost),  trade  and  other  payables, borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values due to their predominant short term nature.
- (ii) Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price quotations as on 31 March. Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair  value  because  of  a  wide  range  of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading. Instead, they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose. Upon the application of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments  at  FVOCI  as  the  directors  believes  this  provides  a  more  meaningful presentation for medium or long term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss.

## C. Valuation technique to determine fair value (Continued)

- (iii) Investments  in  unquoted  preference  shares  carried  at  fair  value  are  based  on discounted cash flow approach. The valuation model considers the present value of expected cash inflows, discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
- (iv) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of  its  financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
- (v) There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 for the year ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

## i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from  the  Company's  receivables  from  customers,  loans  and  investments  in  debt securities.The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.

## Trade receivables

Trade receivables of the Company are typically unsecured and derived from sales made to a large number of independent customers. Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to established policies, procedures and control relating to  customer  credit  risk  management.  Before  accepting  any  new  customer,  the Company has appropriate level  of  control  procedures  to  assess  the  potential customer's credit quality. The credit-worthiness of its customers are reviewed based on their financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. Outstanding customer receivables are reviewed periodically.

The credit risk related to the Trade receivables is mitigated by taking security deposits / bank guarantee / letter of credit / post dated negotiable instruments - as and where considered necessary, setting appropriate credit terms and by setting and monitoring internal limits on exposure to individual customers.

There is no substantial concentration of credit risk as the Revenue / Trade receivables pertaining to any of the single external customer does not exceed 10% of Company revenue.

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on Trade Receivables that is at amortised cost. Loss allowance in respect of financial assets is measured at an amount equal to life time expected credit losses and is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

The  movement  in  the  allowance  for  impairment  in  respect  of  trade  and  other receivables during the Year was as follows:

## Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances/investments with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company's treasury risk management policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within limits assigned to each counterparty. The limits are assigned based on corpus of investable surplus and corpus of the investment avenue. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty's potential failure to make payments.

## 40 Financial Risk Management (Continued)

## i) Credit risk (Continued)

## Financial guarantees

In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Company to banks and financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Company is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.

## ii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes  in  the  interest  rates,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  equity  price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments.

## (a) Currency risk

Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  on  future  commercial  transactions  and  on  all recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The Company's management has set policy wherein exposure is identified, benchmark is set and monitored closely, and accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken.

The Company's foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange imports and exports, primarily with respect to USD,JPY,AED &amp; SGD.

As at the end of the reporting period, the carrying amounts of the company's foreign currency denominated monetary financial assets and financial liabilities in respect of the foreign currencies are as follows:

## Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

A reasonably possible strengthening or (weakening) of the INR against all other currencies  at  31  March  would  have  affected  the  measurement  of  financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

If  INR had (strengthened) /weakened against foreign currency by 5%:

## (b) Equity price risk

Equity  Price  Risk  is  related  to  the  change  in  market  reference  price  of  the investments  in  equity  securities.  The  fair  value  of  some  of  the  Company's investments  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price of securities. The fair value of Company's investment in  quoted  equity  securities  as  at  31  March  2024  and  31  March  2023  was Rs. 7,65,591.04 lakhs and Rs. 3,32,554.89 lakhs respectively. A 10% change in equity price as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 would result in an impact of  Rs.  76,559.10  lakhs  and  Rs.  33,255.49  lakhs  respectively.  The  impact  is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any.

## (c) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates.

As the Company does not have exposure to any floating-interest bearing assets or liabilities, or any significant long-term fixed-interest bearing assets, its interest income /  expenses  and  related  cash  inflows  /  outflows  are  not  affected  by changes in market interest rates.

## 40 Financial Risk Management (Continued)

## ii) Market risk (Continued)

## (c) Interest rate risk (Continued)

The Company has investments in redeemable preference shares of joint ventures and other companies. Future cash flows from these investments in the form of dividends have fixed coupon rate and will not fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. However, the dividend distribution will be subject to availability of adequate profits in the books of respective companies.

## iii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments, if any:

To The Members of

Tata Industries Limited

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Tata Industries Limited (the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries, (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred  to  as  the  'Group'),  its  associates  and  its  joint  ventures,  which  comprise  the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 'the consolidated financial statements').

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred to in the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the  Indian  Accounting  Standards  prescribed  under  Section  133  of  the  Act  read  with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended ('Ind AS'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associates and joint ventures as at 31 March 2024, and their consolidated loss and other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI)  together  with  these  ethical  requirements  that  are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules  made  thereunder,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in 'Other Matters' paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

## Eightieth Annual Report

## Tata  Industries  Limited

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon

The Holding Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the holding Company's annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed and based on the work/audit report of others auditors, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Managements and Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates and joint ventures and for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application  of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true  and  fair  view  and  are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.

## Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls based on our audit.
- Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our

## INDUSTRIES

## Eightieth Annual Report

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities or business activities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditor's. For the other entities or business activities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditor's  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and  timing  of  the  audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

## Other Matters

- a) We did not audit the financial statements of two (2) subsidiaries whose financial statements reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 2,23,383 lakhs as at 31 March 2024, total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 11,323 lakhs and net cash inflows (before consolidation adjustments) amounting to Rs. 319 lakhs for the year ended

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements also include the Group's share of net profit (before consolidation adjustments) (and other comprehensive income) of Rs. 43,588 lakhs for the year ended 31 March 2024, in respect of (1) Joint venture and (2) associates whose financial statements have not been audited by us. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in  so  far  as  it  relates  to  the  amounts  and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, joint venture and associates, and our report in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, joint venture and associates is based solely on the audit reports of the other auditors.

Certain of these subsidiaries are located outside India whose financial statements and other financial information have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries and which have been audited by other auditors  under  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  applicable  in  their  respective countries. The Holding Company's management has converted the financial statements of such subsidiaries located outside India from accounting principles generally accepted in  their  respective  countries  to  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India.  We have audited these conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company's management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiaries located outside India is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by the management of the Holding Company and audited by us.

- b) The financial statements of three (3) step-down subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 85,860 lakhs as at 31 March 2024, total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 2,439 lakhs and net cash Outflows amounting (before consolidation adjustments) to Rs. 1,711 lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements, have not been audited either by us or by other auditors. This unaudited financial statements/financial information  have  been  furnished  to  us  by  the  Management  and  our  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these step-down subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid step-down subsidiaries, is based solely on such unaudited financial statements/financial information. In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, this financial statements/financial information are not material to the Group.
- c) The financial statements / financial information of four (4) associates valued at Rs. Nil in the  consolidated  financial  statements,  have  not  been  considered  in  the  consolidated financial statements. In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by the management, the financial information of these associates is not material to the Group.

## ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

(Referred to in paragraph (A) (f) under 'Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements' section of our report of even date)

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls over financial reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act')

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Tata Industries Limited (the 'Company') as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Holding Company's management and the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of  internal  control  stated  in  the  Guidance  Note.  These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Holding Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation  of  reliable  financial  information,  as  required  under  the  Companies  Act,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal financial controls over financial reporting and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

## ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.

## Meaning of  Internal  Financial  Controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to consolidated financial statements

A  Holding  Company's  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  Holding  company's  internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail, accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  Holding company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Holding company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Holding company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Holding company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to consolidated financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company as of and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Tata  Industries  Limited  (hereinafter referred to as 'the Holding Company') and such companies incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013 which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and its joint venture companies, as of that date.

## ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (Continued)

In our opinion, the Holding company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary, its associate and joint venture companies, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal consolidated financial controls over financial reporting with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria established by such Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'Guidance Note').

## Other Matters

Our  aforesaid  reports  under  Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act  on  the  adequacy  and  operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to subsidiary companies, its associate companies and its joint venture companies which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 1. Background

Tata Industries Limited ('TIL') was incorporated on April 7, 1945 at Mumbai under the Companies Act, VII of 1913 and has been carrying on the business of an investment holding company engaged in the incubation / promotion of new business ventures.

From April 2012 onwards, TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company ('CIC') by the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') on account of its investments being made prominently in other Tata companies. Earlier, it was registered with RBI as a Non-Banking Financial Company.

Besides carrying  out  investment  activities  from  Head  office,  TIL  has  three  operating divisions engaged into management consultancy, data analytics business and healthcare solutions.

These are the consolidated financial statements of TIL and its subsidiaries (collectively 'the Group') and joint ventures and associate companies are mentioned in Note 56 of the financials.

## A. Statement of compliance

The Consolidated Financial Statements ('CFS') comply, in all material aspects, with  Indian  Accounting  Standards  ('Ind  AS')  notified  under  Section  133  of  the Companies Act, 2013 ('the 2013 Act') read with  Rule  3  of  Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.

## B. Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is also TIL's functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest lakhs, unless otherwise indicated.

## C. Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.  Historical  cost  is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation (Continued)

## D. Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Group's interest in joint ventures and associates as at the reporting date.

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries include all the entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through  its  power  to  direct  the  relevant  activities  of  the  entity.  The  Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that  there  are  changes  to  one  or  more  of  the  three  elements  listed  above. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

Inter-company  transactions  and  balances  including  unrealised  profits  are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company's equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisitionby-acquisition  basis.  Subsequent  to  acquisition,  the  carrying  amount  of  noncontrolling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling  interests'  share  of  subsequent  changes  in  equity.  Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Company's interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control  are  accounted  for  as  equity  transactions.  The  carrying  amount  of  the Company's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated  as  the  difference  between  (i)  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  value  of

consideration  received  and  the  fair  value  of  any  retained  interest  and  (ii)  the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit or loss) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed off. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind-AS 109 Financial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

## Joint ventures

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The results assets and liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

A Joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is considered when there is contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint venture. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

## Associates

Associates  are  those  entities  in  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control those policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. The results, assets and liabilities of associates are  incorporated  in  these  financial  statements  using  the  equity  method  of accounting.

## Equity method of accounting (equity accounted investees)

An interest in an associate or joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date in which the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture and are recognised initially at cost. The Group's investment includes goodwill identified on  acquisition,  net  of  any  accumulated  impairment  losses.  The  consolidated financial  statements  include  the  Group's  share  of  profits  or  losses  and  equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.  When  the  Group's  share  of  losses  exceeds  its  interest  in  an  equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments in the nature of net investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of  further  losses  is  discontinued  except  to  the  extent  that  the  Group  has  an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

Dividend received or receivable from associates and joint-ventures are recognised as a reduction in carrying amount of the investment.

The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2E below.

## Changes in the proportion held by NCI

Changes in the proportion of the equity held by NCI are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the controlling interests and NCI are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Group.

## E. Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation (Continued)

## E. Use of estimates and judgements (Continued)

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are  recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the estimate is revised and future periods affected.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

## (i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, considering the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers' warranties and maintenance support. Assumptions also need to be made, when the Group assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.

## (ii) Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations

The  obligation  arising  from  defined  benefit  plan  and  other  long-term employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined by  reference  to  market  yields  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  on government  bonds.  The  period  to  maturity  of  the  underlying  bonds correspond  to  the  probable  maturity  of  the  post-employment  benefit obligations.

## (iii) Recognition of deferred tax assets

Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits.

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation (Continued)

## E. Use of estimates and judgements (Continued)

The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change.

## (iv) Revenue recognition

The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of completion method requires the Group to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.

Provisions  for  estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date.

## (v) Impairment of trade receivables

The Group reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular intervals.  The  Group's  credit  risk  is  primarily  attributable  to  its  trade receivables. In determining whether impairment losses should be reported in the statement of profit and loss, the Group makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, an allowance for expected credit loss is made where there is an identified loss event or condition which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.

## (vi) Impairment losses on investments

The Group reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised cost annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for.

## F. Measurement of fair values

The Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 2. Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation (Continued)

## F. Measurement of fair values (Continued)

The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values, which includes overseeing all significant fair value measurement, including level 3 fair values by the management. The management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.

When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level  1  :  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or liabilities.

Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for  the  asset  or  liability,  either  directly  (i.e.  as  prices)  or  indirectly  (i.e.  derived from prices).

Level 3 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that  is  significant  to  the  entire  measurement.  The  Group  recognises  transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

## 3. Material accounting policies

## A. Foreign currency translation

On initial  recognition,  all  foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates  prevailing  on  the  date  of  the transaction. As at the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

- B. Financial instruments
2. (i) Investments and other financial assets

## Classification

The  Group  classifies  its  financial  assets  in  the  following  measurement categories:

- i) those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income ('OCI'), or through profit and loss), and
2. ii) those measured at amortised cost

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial  assets  and  the  contractual  terms  of  the  cash  flows.  For  assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in statement of profit and loss or OCI. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investment in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through OCI.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

## Debt instruments

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

## Amortised cost

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)
- B. Financial instruments (Continued)
3. (i) Investments and other financial assets (Continued)

## Fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI')

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of  principal  and  interest,  are  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI'). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ (losses) within other income or other expense. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method.

## Fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL ')

Assets  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for  amortised  cost  or  FVTOCI  are measured at fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  A  gain  or  loss  on  a  debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/(losses) within other income or other expense in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income.

## Equity instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Other Income when the Group's right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as gains/(losses)  within  other  income  or  other  expense  in  the  Statement  of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

## Cash and cash equivalents

The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant

risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or less  from  the  date  of  purchase,  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Cash  and  cash equivalents  consist  of  balances  with  banks  which  are  unrestricted  for withdrawal and usage.

## De-recognition of financial assets

A financial asset is derecognised only when the Group

- has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset; or
- retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.

Where the Group transfers an asset, it evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. Where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the Group has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the Group has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.

## (i) Debt and equity instruments (liabilities)

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.  Equity  instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

## (ii) Financial liabilities

The Group's financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and other liabilities. These are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

- B. Financial instruments (Continued)
2. (ii) Financial liabilities (Continued)

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.

Changes to  the  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  liability  as  a  result  of renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of the financial liability, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## De-recognition of financial liabilities

The  Group  derecognises  financial  liabilities  when,  and  only  when,  its obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures.  Derivative  instruments  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss.

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the  variability  in  cash  flows  associated  with  highly  probable  forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. At inception of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Group  documents  the  risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also  documents  the  economic  relationship  between  hedged  item  and hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

## Cash Flow Hedge

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective  portion  of  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivatives  is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under ' effective portion of cash flow hedges'. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge item, determined on a present value basis, from the inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss.

## B. Financial instruments (Continued)

## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (Continued)

The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When the hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.

If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that  have  been  accumulated  in  other  equity  are  immediately reclassified in profit and loss.

## (iv) Financial guarantee contracts

The Group on a case to case basis elects to account for financial guarantee contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract, as specified in  Ind  AS  109  on  Financial  Instruments  and  Ind  AS  104  on  Insurance Contracts. The Group has regarded all its financial guarantee contracts as insurance contracts. At the end of each reporting period the Group performs a liability adequacy test, (i.e. it assesses the likelihood of a pay-out based on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows), and any deficiency is recognized in profit or loss.

## (v) Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a legally  enforceable  right  (not  contingent  on  future  events)  to  off-set  the recognised amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

## C. Property, Plant and Equipment

## Recognition and measurement

All  items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment are stated at their historical cost of acquisition  or  construction  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment  losses  if  any.  Historical  cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## C. Property, plant and equipment (Continued)

as  a  separate  asset  is  derecognised  when  replaced.  All  other  repairs  and maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the  item  to  working  condition  for  its  intended  use,  and  estimated  costs  of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.

Any  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is recognised in profit or loss.

Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress account. At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries and associates has been provided on Straight Line Method (SLM), considering the useful lives and residual value prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the following categories of assets, in whose case the  life  of  the  assets  has  been  assessed  as  under  based  on  technical  advice, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating  conditions  of  the  asset,  past  history  of  replacement,  anticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support:

## Research and development expenses

Revenue expenses pertaining to research is charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Development cost of products are also charged to consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  unless  a  product's  technical  feasibility  has  been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. The amount capitalized comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended use. Fixed assets utilized for research and development are capitalized and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for the property, plant and equipment.

## E. Investment property

## Recognition and measurement

Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.

## Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

## Depreciation

Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes a  period  of  60  years  representing  the  best  estimate  of  the  period  over  which investment property (which is quite similar) is expected to be used. Accordingly, the  company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a straight-line basis.

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## E. Investment property (Continued)

## Reclassification from / to investment property

Transfers to (or from) investment property are made only when there is a change in  use.  Transfers  between  investment  property,  owner-occupied  property  and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and they  do  not  change  the  cost  of  that  property  for  measurement  or  disclosure purposes.

## Fair value disclosure

The fair  values  of  investment  property  is  disclosed  in  the  notes.  Fair  values  is determined  by  an  independent  valuer  who  holds  a  recognised  and  relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.

## F. Inventories

Stock-in-trade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of traded goods is determined on First-in-First out (FIFO) basis and includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The comparison of cost and net realizable value  is  made  on  an  item  by  item  basis.  Provision  is  made  for  the  cost  of obsolescence and other anticipated losses, whenever considered necessary.

## G. Impairment

## Impairment of financial instruments (other than at fair value)

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with  its  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost  and  FVTOCI  debt  instruments.  The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

## Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment is recognised.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## G. Impairment (Continued)

The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is  indication  that  an  impairment  loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## H. Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale

Non-current  assets,  or  disposal  groups  comprising  assets  and  liabilities  are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resultant loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, and biological assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated.

## I. Employee benefits

## Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are  classified  as  short-term  employee  benefits.  These  benefits  include compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised during the year.

## Defined Contribution plans

The Group makes monthly contributions to the Superannuation fund and National pension scheme for all qualifying employees, until retirement or resignation of the employee. The Group recognizes such contributions as an expense when incurred. The Group has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## I. Employee benefits (Continued)

## Defined benefit plans

The Group operates the post-employment schemes such as Gratuity, Provident fund and Post-retirement medical benefits (PRMB) and Pension to an ex-director which are defined benefit plans.

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method. This  approach  determines  the  present  value  of  the  interest  rate  guarantee  to employees. Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans, since the Group  is  obliged  to  meet  interest  shortfall,  if  any,  with  respect  to  covered employees.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising  from  experience  adjustments  and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in the other comprehensive income.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service cost.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services. They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## I. Employee benefits (Continued)

to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurement as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement of profit and loss.

## Other long-term employee benefits (Continued)

The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

## J. Provisions

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation. Provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows (representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating losses are not provided for.

A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before such a provision is made, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## K. Revenue recognition

The Group has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is to be recognised.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in exchange for those products or services.

The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that

## Eightieth Annual Report

## Tata  Industries  Limited

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## K. Revenue recognition (Continued)

reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:

- Step 1 : Identify the contract(s) with a customer
- Step 2 : Identify the performance obligation in contract
- Step 3 : Determine the transaction price
- Step 4 : Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
- Step 5 : Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation

Under Ind AS 115, an entity  recognises  revenue  when  (or  as)  a  performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when 'control' of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

## Rendering of services

In respect of contracts, other than ClassEdge license and support fees, revenue on  time-and-material  contracts  are  recognized  as  the  related  services  are performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date is recognized  as  unbilled  revenue.  Revenue  from  fixed-price,  fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is recognized as per the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion. Projected losses, if any,  are  provided  in  entirety  as  per  Ind  AS  based  on  management's  current estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of technical assessment of time and effort required and estimates of future expenditure.

Revenue from licensing of ClassEdge content to schools is recognized, on a prorata basis over the contract period, commensurate with the services rendered / cost incurred for the same. The Group has applied the guidance in Ind AS 115 by  applying  the  revenue  recognition  criteria  for  each  distinct  performance obligation.  The  arrangements  with  customers  generally  meet  the  criteria  for considering  equipment,  software  licenses  and  support  services  as  distinct performance obligations. The performance obligations are satisfied as and when the  services  are  rendered  since  the  customer  consumes  the  services  as  time progresses.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## K. Revenue recognition (Continued)

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets (which are referred to  as  unbilled  revenue)  while  invoicing  in  excess  of  revenues  are  classified  as contract liabilities (which are referred to as unearned revenues).

Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue ('contract liability') is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

Revenue from After School (AFS) License subscription consist of subscription fees charged for subscription-based online educational content.

Content subscription fee is received in advance and is record as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized uniformly over the contract  period  as  the  subscription services  represent  a  obligation  to  provide  the  services  while  the  customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of such services throughout the contract period.

## Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns (if any), trade discounts, rebates, and goods and service tax.

Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract. Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of the customer contract, except in case where the amortisation period is one year or less, in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred.

## Interest income

Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate,

## K. Revenue recognition (Continued)

the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instruments (for example, prepayment, extension) but does not consider the expected credit loss.

## Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.

## L. Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

## Group as a lessee

The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately  from  non-lease  components  of  the  contract  and  allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the rightof-use  asset  measured  at  inception  shall  comprise  of  the  amount  of  the  initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct  costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  to  be  incurred  by  the  lessee  in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at  cost  less  any  accumulated  depreciation,  accumulated  impairment  losses,  if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.

Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## L. Leases (Continued)

The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined.  If  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  determined,  the  Company  uses incremental  borrowing  rate.  For  leases  with  reasonably  similar  characteristics, the  Company,  on  a  lease  by  lease  basis,  may  adopt  either  the  incremental borrowing rate  specific  to  the  lease  or  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  for  the portfolio as a whole.

The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value  guarantees,  exercise  price  of  a  purchase  option  where  the  Company  is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.

The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease  payments  made  and  remeasuring  the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.

The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-ofuse asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## Group as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on  a  pattern  reflecting  a  constant  periodic  rate  of  return  on  the  lessor's  net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for

## L. Leases (Continued)

its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it  classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Group has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April  1,  2019  and  applied  the  standard  to  its  leases,  retrospectively,  with  the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard, recognised on the date of initial application (April 1, 2019). Accordingly, the Company has not restated comparative information, instead, the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as on April 1, 2019.

The Group has applied the Covid -19 related concession - amendment to Ind AS 116. The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and will affect the current &amp; future periods only.

## M. Income Tax

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates  to  a  business  combination  or  to  an  item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

## Current tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024

## 3. Significant accounting policies (Continued)

## M. Income Tax (Continued)

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is also recognised in  respect  of  carried  forward  tax  losses  and  tax  credits.  Deferred  tax  is  not recognised for:

- temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Group recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against  which  such  deferred  tax  asset  can  be  realised.  Deferred  tax  assetsunrecognised  or  recognised,  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date  and  are recognised/  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable/  no  longer  probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

## M. Income Tax (Continued)

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised  within  the  measurement  period  reduce  goodwill  related  to  that acquisition  if  they  result  from  new  information  obtained  about  facts  and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain purchase gains. All other acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in profit or loss.

## N. Discontinued Operations

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and

- is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
- is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.

Classification  as  a  discontinued  operation  occurs  upon  disposal  or  when  the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.

When an operation is classified  as  a  discontinued  operation,  the  comparative statement  of  profit  and  loss  is  re-presented  as  if  the  operation  had  been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

## O. Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are  interest  and  other  costs  (including  exchange  differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly  attributable  to  acquisition  or  construction  of  an  asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

## P. Operating Segments

An operating Segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relates to transactions with any of Group's other components, and for which discrete financial information is available. All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group's Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their performance.

## Q. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable  to  equity  shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

## R. Business combinations

## Business combinations under common control

Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted in accordance with 'Pooling of Interest Method' laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 (Ind AS 103) Business combinations of entities  under  common control ,  notified  under  the  Companies Act, 2013.

All assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books of account of the Group at their existing carrying amounts. Inter-company balances are eliminated. The difference, between the investments held by the Group and all assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recognised in capital reserve  and  presented  separately  from  other  capital  reserves.  Comparative accounting period presented in the financial statements of the Group has been restated for the accounting impact of the merger, as stated above, as if the merger had  occurred  from  the  beginning  of  the  comparative  period  in  the  financial statements.

Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets. This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis.

## R. Business combinations (Continued)

## Business combinations not under common control

Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in  the  acquiree  at  fair  value  or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual  terms,  economic  circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest  held,  over  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised

in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are  adjusted  through  goodwill  during  the  measurement  period,  or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. These adjustments are called as measurement period adjustments. The measurement period does not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

After  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  any  accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a  business  combination  is,  from  the  acquisition  date,  allocated  to  each  of  the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually,  or  more  frequently  when  there  is  an  indication  that  the  unit  may  be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying  amount,  the  impairment  loss  is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit  and  part  of  the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative  values  of  the  disposed  operation  and  the  portion  of  the cash-generating unit retained.

## R. Business combinations (Continued)

The excess of the consideration transferred, amount of the non-controlling interest, and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest is the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

## S. Provisions and contingencies

A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of the money is material). The increase in the provisions due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. Provisions are reviewed as at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current estimate.

Contingent liabilities  are  disclosed  when  there  is  a  possible  obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.

Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

## 41 Segment reporting

- A. An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which discrete financial information is available. Operating results of all operating segments are reviewed regularly by the management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance.

The Company has seven reportable segments and two reported segments, as described below,  which  are  the  Company's  strategic  business  units.  These  business  units  offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the business units, the Company's management reviews internal management reports on at least a monthly basis.

The following  summary describes the operations in  each  of  the  Group's  reportable  / reported segments:

## Segment reporting (Continued)

Information regarding the results of each reportable / reported segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit (before tax), as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the management. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis.

## B. Measurement of fair values

The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:

## Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares.

## Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes derivative contracts.

## Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole  or  in  part,  using  a  valuation  model  based  on  assumptions  that  are  neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This level of hierarchy includes investments in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.

## C. Valuation technique to determine fair value

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments:

- (i) Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables,  loans  (measured  at  amortised  cost),  trade  and  other  payables, borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values due to their predominant short term nature.
- (ii) Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price quotations as on 31 March. Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair  value  because  of  a  wide  range  of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.

## C. Valuation technique to determine fair value (Continued)

Instead, they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose. Upon the application of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments  at  FVOCI  as  the  directors  believes  this  provides  a  more  meaningful presentation for medium or long term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss.

- (iii) Investments in unquoted shares carried at fair value are based on discounted cash flow approach. The valuation model considers the present value of expected cash inflows, discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
- (iv) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of  its  financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
- (v) There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

## 45 Financial Risk Management (Continued)

the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Board of Directors is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit.

Asset  Liability  Management  Committee  reviews  asset  liability  mismatch,  if  any,  debt composition and plan of the Company for fund raising of the Company.

## i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, loans and investments in debt securities.The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.

## Trade receivables

Trade receivables of the Company are typically unsecured and derived from sales made to a large number of independent customers. Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to established policies, procedures and control relating to customer credit  risk  management.  Before  accepting  any  new  customer,  the  Company  has appropriate level of control procedures to assess the potential customer's credit quality. The credit-worthiness of its customers are reviewed based on their financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. Outstanding customer receivables are reviewed periodically.

The credit risk related to the Trade receivables is mitigated by taking security deposits /  bank guarantee / letter of credit / post dated negotiable instruments - as and where considered necessary, setting appropriate credit terms and by setting and monitoring internal limits on exposure to individual customers.

## i) Credit risk (Continued)

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on Trade Receivables that is at amortised cost. Loss allowance in respect of financial assets is measured at an amount equal to life time expected credit losses and is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows:

There is no substantial concentration of credit risk as the Revenue / Trade receivables pertaining to any single external customer does not exceed 10% of Group's revenue.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows:

## 45 Financial Risk Management (Continued)

## i) Credit risk (Continued)

## Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances/investments with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Company's treasury risk management policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within limits assigned to each counterparty. The limits are assigned based on corpus of investable surplus and corpus of the investment avenue. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty's potential failure to make payments.

## Financial guarantees

In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Group to banks and financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.

## ii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.

## (a) Currency risk

Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group. The Group's management has set policy wherein exposure is identified,  benchmark  is  set  and  monitored  closely,  and  accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken.

The  Group's  foreign  currency  exposure  arises  mainly  from  foreign  exchange imports and exports, primarily with respect to USD, EURO, SGD, AED, CHF, HUF, JPY and GBP .

## ii) Market risk (Continued)

## (b) Equity price risk

Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities. The fair value of some of the Company's investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price of securities. The fair value of Company's investment in quoted equity securities as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 was Rs. 7,65,591.04 lakhs and Rs. 3,32,554.89 lakhs respectively. A 10% change in equity price as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 would result in an impact of Rs. 76,559.10 lakhs and Rs. 33,255.49 lakhs respectively. The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any.

## (c) Interest rate risk

Interest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates.

As  the  Group  does  not  have  exposure  to  any  floating-interest  bearing  assets  or liabilities, or any significant long-term fixed-interest bearing assets, its interest income / expenses and related cash inflows / outflows are not affected by changes in market interest rates.

The Group has investments in redeemable preference shares of joint  ventures, associates and other companies. Future cash flows from these investments in the form of dividends have fixed coupon rate and will not fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. However, the dividend distribution will be subject to availability of adequate profits in the books of respective companies.

## iii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.

The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments, if  any:

| g In Flisom AG, contingent liability exists in connection to project grants received from the European Commission in the period 2012-2015. This potential claim of up to 1'348'627 EUR is due to a dispute over the maintenance of project timesheets. However as all Technical Milestones were signed off by the European Commission and that Flisom holds Certificates on the Financial Statements of the Projects Flisom has disputed this claim and thus disagrees with the European Commission's assessment of the projects. Current status is 'on hold'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1,133.68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 50 Disclosures under Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Continued)

The unbilled revenue (contract assets) primarily relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The amount of contract assets during the period ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 were impacted by impairment charges of Rs. Nil lakhs and Rs. Nil respectively. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Company issues an invoice to the customer.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 to 90 days.

The  advance  from  customers  (contract  liabilities)  primarily  relate  to  the  advance consideration received from customers while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as income received in advance, both of which constitute contract liabilities. These will be recognised as revenue when the Group fulfils the performance obligations.
