Alphabet Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – October 29, 2025 – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced
financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.
• Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2025 increased 16%, or 15% in constant currency, year over year to
$102.3 billion. Google Search & other, YouTube ads, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and
Google Cloud each delivered double-digit growth in Q3.
• Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 billion, reflecting robust performance across Google
Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and YouTube ads.
• Google Cloud revenues increased 34% to $15.2 billion, led by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
across core products, AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions.
• Total operating income increased 9% and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the $3.5 billion charge
related to the European Commission (EC) fine, operating income increased 22% and operating margin was
33.9%, benefitting from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in the expense base.
• Other income reflected a net gain of $12.8 billion, primarily the result of net unrealized gains on our nonmarketable
equity securities.
• Net income increased 33% and EPS increased 35% to $2.87.
• With the growth across our business and demand from Cloud customers, we now expect 2025 capital
expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion to $93 billion.
“Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We delivered our
first-ever $100 billion quarter,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.
“Our full stack approach to AI is delivering strong momentum and we’re shipping at speed, including the global
rollout of AI Overviews and AI Mode in Search in record time. In addition to topping leaderboards, our first party
models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute, via direct API use by our customers. The Gemini App
now has over 650 million monthly active users. We continue to drive strong growth in new businesses. Google
Cloud accelerated, ending the quarter with $155 billion in backlog. And we have over 300 million paid subscriptions
led by Google One and YouTube Premium.”
“We are investing to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities across the company.”

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we
use the following non-GAAP financial measures: operating income, excluding the EC fine; operating margin, excluding
the EC fine; free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The
presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior
to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate
period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental
information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our
recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate
movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management
and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when
planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s
internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating
results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2)
they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial
measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in
accordance with GAAP.
For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation of
GAAP Operating Income and Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Income and Operating Margin, Excluding the
EC Fine”, “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow”, and
“Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in
Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.

Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Income and Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Income and
Operating Margin, Excluding the EC Fine (in millions, except percentages; unaudited):
We provide the following non-GAAP measures because they provide useful information to management and
investors about the effect of the EC fine on operating income and operating margin in the third quarter of 2025 for
comparability to operating income and operating margin in the third quarter of 2024.
• Non-GAAP operating income, excluding the EC fine
• Non-GAAP operating margin, excluding the EC fine
These non-GAAP measures exclude the effect of the EC fine recorded during the third quarter of 2025. We
calculate the percentage change by comparing operating income, excluding the EC fine recorded in the third quarter
of 2025 to the prior year comparable quarter.
Quarter Ended September 30,
2024 2025 % Change
Revenues $ 88,268 $ 102,346 16 %
Operating income (GAAP) $ 28,521 $ 31,228 9 %

Operating margin (GAAP) 32.3 % 30.5 %
Operating margin, excluding the EC fine (Non-GAAP) 32.3 % 33.9 %
Non-GAAP operating income, excluding the EC fine: We define Non-GAAP operating income, excluding the EC fine as operating
income excluding the EC fine.
Non-GAAP operating margin, excluding the EC fine: We define Non-GAAP operating margin, excluding the EC fine as Non-
GAAP operating income, excluding the EC fine divided by revenues.

Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (in
millions; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a
liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash
generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and
acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

Free cash flow $ 24,837 $ 18,953 $ 5,301 $ 24,461 $ 73,552
Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
TTM free cash flow: We define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital
expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.

Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage
Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues (in millions, except
percentages; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change
in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the
comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX
Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our
core operating results.
Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate
movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange
rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in
constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues,
excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
