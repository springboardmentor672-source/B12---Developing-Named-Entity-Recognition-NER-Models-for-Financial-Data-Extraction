MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
Company Overview
Tata Industries Limited (“TIL” / “the Company”) is registered with the Reserve Bank of India
as a Core Investment Company. The Company is an investment holding company and is part
of the promoter group with shareholding in Group companies apart from being engaged in
incubation / promotion of new business ventures.
As on March 31, 2024, the Company has 3 subsidiaries and the Company together with its
divisions, subsidiaries and a joint venture entity are engaged in diversified businesses including
Strategy and Management Consulting, Data Analytics, Healthcare Diagnostics, Education
Technology, Healthsciences and Biosciences.
More than 90% of the net assets of the Company are in the form of investments in various Tata
companies. The primary source of inflow is dividends received from Tata companies,
occasionally supplemented by sale of investments.
Business Highlights
The Company’s investing strategy is driven by assessments of technology developments that
create business opportunities in areas ranging from Edtech to Healthcare.
The Company continues to make investments in existing businesses to enable them to capitalize
on growth opportunities.
In Strategy & Management Consulting, the Company sees strong opportunity to serve clients
more deeply and to improve functional excellence, as well as facilitate ongoing transformations.
There could be risks relating to retention of the high-quality talent which is relied on by the
business, due to competitive intensity. Changes in the business environment could lead to
deferment of projects by clients.
In Data Analytics, the Company sees opportunities in growing digitization and increasing value
creation that analytics can generate in key sectors, apart from new regulations requiring better
data governance. Possible risks include data sensitivity with the threat of cyber-attacks, and
retention of talent in a rapidly growing data-centric environment.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT (Continued)
Internal control systems and their adequacy
The Company’s internal controls are commensurate with its size and the nature of operations.
These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and
providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes,
safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To
The Members of
Tata Industries Limited
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Tata Industries Limited
(the “Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the Statement
of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and
the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of material
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to
us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the
Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company
as at 31 March 2024, and its loss and other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards
on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the
consolidated financial statements, the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report
thereon.

INDUSTRIES
Eightieth Annual Report
Tata Industries Limited
36
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management and Board of Director’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in
section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management and
Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting
process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and

37
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has
adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of
such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of
Directors.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to
cease to continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

INDUSTRIES

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that,
individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and
in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements
in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.

(Referred to in paragraph 2 (A) (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’
section of our report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
We have audited the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting of Tata Industries
Limited (the “Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone
financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management and the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and
maintaining Internal Financial Controls based on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial
Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct
of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the
Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”).
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements of the Company based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards
on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit
of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively
in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the
internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to
standalone financial statements.

ANNEXURE “B” TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to
standalone financial statements
A Company’s Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial
control with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with
reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with
reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the
internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting with reference to standalone financial statements and such Internal
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024,
based on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to standalone
financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance
Note”).

1.
Background
Tata Industries Limited (‘TIL’) was incorporated on April 7, 1945 at Mumbai under the
Companies Act, VII of 1913 and has been carrying on the business of an investment
holding company engaged in the incubation / promotion of new business ventures.
From April 2012 onwards, TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company (‘CIC’) by
the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on account of its investments being made prominently
in other Tata companies. Earlier, it was registered with RBI as a Non-Banking Financial
Company.
Besides carrying out investment activities from Head office, TIL has three operating
divisions engaged into management consultancy, data analytics business and healthcare
solutions.
The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2024 and authorised for issue on 29 April 2024.
2.
Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical
accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
A.
Statement of compliance
These Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
Indian Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act,
2013 (the Act) read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as
amended from time to time, other relevant provisions of the Act and the Prudential
norms directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India as applicable to Core
Investment Companies.
B.
Functional and presentation currency
These Standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which
is also Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to the
nearest lakhs, unless otherwise indicated.
C.
Basis of preparation
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods
and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.

57
NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
D.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS
standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised and future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year are discussed below:
(i)
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets
and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised.
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule
II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different
from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on technical advice,
considering the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the
operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and maintenance support.
Assumptions are also made, when the Company assesses whether an asset
may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be
capitalised.
(ii)
Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan and other long-term
employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions. Key
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and
vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on
government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds
correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit
obligations.

(iii)
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of
deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing
and the level of future taxable profits.
The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected
future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change.
(iv)
Revenue recognition
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for
its fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of completion method
requires the Company to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as
a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs
expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there
is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the
expected contract estimates at the reporting date.
(v)
Impairment of trade receivables
The Company reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular
intervals. The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
receivables. In determining whether impairment losses should be reported
in the statement of profit and loss, the Company makes judgments as to
whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable
decrease in the estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, an allowance for
expected credit loss is made where there is an identified loss event or
condition which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction
in the recoverability of the cash flows.
(vi)
Impairment losses on investments
The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised
cost annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment
loss is accounted for.

E.
Measurement of fair values
The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of
fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
The Company has an established control framework with respect to the
measurement of fair values, which includes overseeing all significant fair value
measurement, including Level 3 fair values by the management. The management
regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If
third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure
fair values, then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third
parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of
Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations
should be classified.
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the
Company uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used
in the valuation techniques as follows:
Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
from prices).
Level 3 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised
in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input
that is significant to the entire measurement. The Company recognises transfers
between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during
which the change has occurred.
3.
Material accounting policies
A.
Foreign currency translation
On initial recognition, all foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the
transaction. As at the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the
exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Financial instruments
(i)
Investments and other financial assets
Classification
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement
categories:
i)
those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other
comprehensive income (‘OCI’), or through profit and loss), and
ii)
those measured at amortised cost
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for
managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash
flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either
be recorded in statement of profit and loss or OCI. For investments
in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which
the investment is held. For investment in equity instruments, this will
depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election
at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment
at fair value through OCI.
The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its
business model for managing those assets changes.
Debt instruments
At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its
fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through
profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets
carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or
loss. Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the
Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow
characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories
into which the Company classifies its debt instruments:
Amortised cost
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where
those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest
are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment
that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a
hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets
is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.
3.
Significant accounting policies (Continued)

NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
Fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’)
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for
selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent
solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value
through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’).
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for
the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and
foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in Statement
of Profit and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified
from equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ (losses) within
other income or other expense. Interest income from these financial
assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate
method.
Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are
measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt
investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part
of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented
net in the Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/(losses) within other
income or other expense in the period in which it arises. Interest
income from these financial assets is included in other income.
Equity instruments
The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair
value. Where the Company’s management has elected to present fair
value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no
subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the
Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from such investments are
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Other Income when
the Company’s right to receive payments is established. Changes in
the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as gains/
(losses) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and
reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at
FVTOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject
to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities
of three months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks
which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised only when the Company
•
has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial
asset; or
•
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the
financial assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the
cash flows to one or more recipients.
Where the Company transfers an asset, it evaluates whether it has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset. Where the Company has transferred substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership, the financial asset is derecognised.
Where the Company has not transferred substantially all risks and
rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not
derecognised. Where the Company has neither transferred a financial
asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of
the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Company
has not retained control of the financial asset.
Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset
is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement
in the financial asset.
(ii)
Debt and equity instruments (liabilities)
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments
issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.

(iii)
Financial liabilities
The Company’s financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and
other liabilities. These are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction
costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost
of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or,
where appropriate, a shorter period.
Changes to the carrying amount of a financial liability as a result of
renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of
the financial liability, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, its
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
(iv)
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign
currency exposures. Derivative instruments are initially measured at fair
value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair
value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss.
The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to
hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast
transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. At inception
of designated hedging relationships, the Company documents the risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The
Company also documents the economic relationship between hedged item
and hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
Cash Flow Hedge
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the
effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives is

recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under ‘effective
portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective portion of the changes in the fair
value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedge item, determined on a present value basis,
from the inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of the changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss.
The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in
the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash
flows affect profit and loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging
instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then the hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. When the hedge accounting for
cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated
in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods
as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the
amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately
reclassified in profit and loss.
(v)
Financial guarantee contracts
The Company on a case to case basis elects to account for financial
guarantee contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract,
as specified in Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments and Ind AS 104 on
Insurance Contracts. The Company has regarded all its financial guarantee
contracts as insurance contracts. At the end of each reporting period the
Company performs a liability adequacy test, (i.e. it assesses the likelihood
of a pay-out based on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows),
and any deficiency is recognized in profit or loss.
(vi)
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a
legally enforceable right (not contingent on future events) to off-set the
recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis,
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost of
acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as
a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for
as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and
maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period
in which they are incurred.
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises
the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing
the item to working condition for its intended use, and estimated costs of
dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is
recognised in profit or loss.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress
account. At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended
by management, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category
of property, plant and equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning of an
asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and
the asset is ready for its intended use.
Depreciation on tangible fixed assets of the Company has been provided on
Straight Line Method (SLM), considering the useful lives and residual value
prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the
following categories of assets, in whose case the life of the assets has been
assessed as under based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of
the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset,
past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers
warranties and maintenance support:

Research and development expenses
Revenue expenses pertaining to research is charged to the standalone statement

statement of profit and loss unless a product’s technical feasibility has been
established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. The amount capitalized
comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable
and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its
intended use. Property, plant and equipment utilized for research and development
are capitalized and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for the
property, plant and equipment.

Investment property
Recognition and measurement
Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital
appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use

in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost, including
related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property
is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.
Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when
it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected
from its disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property (calculated
as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount
of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of
the item can be measured reliably.
Depreciation
Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes
a period of 60 years representing the best estimate of the period over which
investment property (which is quite similar) is expected to be used. Accordingly,
the company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a
straight-line basis.
Reclassification from / to investment property
Transfers to (or from) investment property are made only when there is a change
in use. Transfers between investment property, owner-occupied property and
inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and
they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure
purposes.
Fair value disclosure
The fair values of investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values is
determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant
professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category
of the investment property being valued.

Inventories
Stock-in-trade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make
the sale. Cost of traded goods is determined on First-in-First out (FIFO) basis and
includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. The comparison of cost and net realizable
value is made on an item by item basis. Provision is made for the cost of
obsolescence and other anticipated losses, whenever considered necessary.
G.
Impairment
Impairment of financial instruments (other than at fair value)
The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss
associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments.
The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a
significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Company applies
the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, which
requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the
receivables.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date
are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of
such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount
of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment is recognised.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in
use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present
value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each
Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss
recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have
decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of
Profit and Loss.

Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale

69
NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resultant loss on a disposal
group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on
pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets,
deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, and biological assets, which continue
to be measured in accordance with the Company’s other accounting policies.
Losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses
on re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated.
I.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service
are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include
compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of
short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services
rendered by employees is recognised during the year.
Defined Contribution plans
The Company makes monthly contributions to the Superannuation fund and
National pension scheme for all qualifying employees, until retirement or
resignation of the employee. The Company recognizes such contributions as an
expense when incurred. The Company has no further obligation beyond its monthly
contribution.
Defined benefit plans
The Company operates the post-employment schemes such as Gratuity, Provident
fund and post-retirement medical benefits (PRMB) and Pension to an ex-director
which are defined benefit plans.
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit
plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated
annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for
measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method.
This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee to
employees. Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans, since the
Company is obliged to meet interest shortfall, if any, with respect to covered
employees.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting
the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the
reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms
of the related obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance
of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. This cost
is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur,
directly in the other comprehensive income.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan
amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service
cost.
Other long-term employee benefits
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly
after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services.
They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to
be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting
period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using
the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating
to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurement as a result of experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement
of profit and loss.
The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting
period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

Revenue recognition
The Company has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much
and when revenue is to be recognised.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in
exchange for those products or services.
The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach
to revenue recognition:
•
Step 1 :
Identify the contract(s) with a customer
•
Step 2 :
Identify the performance obligation in contract
•
Step 3 :
Determine the transaction price
•
Step 4 :
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract
•
Step 5 :
Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation
Under Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance
obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the
particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Rendering of services
In respect of contracts, revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as
the related services are performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing
to the reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue. Revenue from fixed-price,
fixed-time frame contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over
time and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of
consideration, is recognized as per the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts
or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion.
Projected losses, if any, are provided in entirety as per Ind AS based on
management’s current estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of
technical assessment of time and effort required and estimates of future
expenditure.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration,
adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price
concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer.
Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.
Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets (which are referred
to as unbilled revenue) while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as
contract liabilities (which are referred to as unearned revenues).
Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings
on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of
invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only
passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are
billings in excess of revenues.
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods
to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns (if any), trade discounts, rebates,
and goods and service tax.
Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract.
Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of
the customer contract, except in case where the amortisation period is one year
or less, in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred.
Interest income
Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest
rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross
carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate,
the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual
terms of the financial instruments (for example, prepayment, extension) but does
not consider the expected credit loss.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Company’s
right to receive payment is established.

Leases
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Company as a lessee
The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease
separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative
stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of
the non-lease components.
The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost
of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of
the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any
initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee
in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset
or site on which it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured
at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if
any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use
assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date
over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated
useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of
property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment
whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and
loss.
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate
can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company
uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics,
the Company, on a lease by lease basis, may adopt either the incremental
borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the
portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable
lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option
where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments
of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising
an option to terminate the lease.

NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount
to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any
reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease
payments.
The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as
an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement
of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-
measurement in statement of profit and loss.
The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to short-
term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases
for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated
with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.
Company as a lessor
At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either
an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments
received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease
term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term
based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net
investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts
for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the
lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising
from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease
is a short term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described
above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies
Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract.
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning
April 1, 2019 and applied the standard to its leases, retrospectively, with the
cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard, recognised on the date of initial
application (April 1, 2019).

company has applied the Covid -19 related concession – amendment to Ind AS
116. The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior
periods and will affect the current & future periods only.
L.
Income Tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss
except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or to an item
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income
or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect
of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax
amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any,
related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise
the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is also recognised
in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax is not
recognised for:
•
temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities
in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
a.
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and
joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

b.
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. The existence
of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not
be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Company
recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable
temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient
taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be
realised. Deferred tax assets- unrecognised or recognised, are reviewed at
each reporting date and are recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is
probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will
be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. The
measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow
from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable
right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on
different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets
on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying
the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently
if new information about facts and circumstances change. Acquired deferred
tax benefits recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill
related to that acquisition if they result from new information obtained about
facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. If the carrying
amount of goodwill is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits are
recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for
bargain purchase gains. All other acquired tax benefits realised are
recognised in profit or loss.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset
which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended

operating results are reviewed regularly by the Company’s Board to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their performance.

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year
attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity
shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings
per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders
and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Q.
Business combinations
Business combinations under common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under
the common control are accounted in accordance with “Pooling of Interest Method”
laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 (Ind AS 103) Business
combinations of entities under common control, notified under the Companies
Act, 2013.
All assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books
of account of the Company at their existing carrying amounts. Inter-company
balances are eliminated. The difference, between the investments held by the
Company and all assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are
recognised in capital reserve and presented separately from other capital reserves.
Comparative accounting period presented in the financial statements of the
Company has been restated for the accounting impact of the merger, as stated
above, as if the merger had occurred from the beginning of the comparative period
in the financial statements.
Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets.
This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis.
Business combinations not under common control
Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate
of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business
combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities
assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they
are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable.
When the Company acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and
liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance
3.

with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as
at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in
host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at
fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset
or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial
Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in
profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109,
it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and
subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests,
and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the
aggregate consideration transferred, the Company re-assesses whether it has
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and
reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of
net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain
is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if
there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain
directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the
reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Company reports provisional
amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional
amounts are adjusted through goodwill during the measurement period, or
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. These adjustments are
called as measurement period adjustments. The measurement period does not
exceed one year from the acquisition date.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the

Company’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are
assigned to those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the
unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment
loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed
operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining
the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the
cash-generating unit retained.
R.
Provisions and contingencies
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows
(representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating
losses are not provided for.
A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to
be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost
of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract
is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before
such a provision is made, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the
assets associated with that contract.

NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising
from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the
control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where
it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or
a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow
of economic benefits is probable.

B.
Measurement of fair values
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured
subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described
below:
Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists
of investment in quoted equity shares.
Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This level of
hierarchy includes derivative contracts.
Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined
in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument
nor are they based on available market data. This level of hierarchy includes investments
in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.
C.
Valuation technique to determine fair value
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial
instruments:
(i)
Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
receivables, loans (measured at amortised cost), trade and other payables,
borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying
value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair
values due to their predominant short term nature.
(ii)
Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price
quotations as on 31 March. Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been
considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of
possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value
within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.
Instead, they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose. Upon the application
of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity
instruments at FVOCI as the directors believes this provides a more meaningful
presentation for medium or long term strategic investments, than reflecting changes
in fair value immediately in profit or loss.

(iii)
Investments in unquoted preference shares carried at fair value are based on
discounted cash flow approach. The valuation model considers the present value of
expected cash inflows, discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
(iv)
Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial
instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
(v)
There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 for the year
ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

i)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty
to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally
from the Company’s receivables from customers, loans and investments in debt
securities.The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit
risk exposure.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables of the Company are typically unsecured and derived from sales
made to a large number of independent customers. Customer credit risk is managed
by each business unit subject to established policies, procedures and control relating
to customer credit risk management. Before accepting any new customer, the
Company has appropriate level of control procedures to assess the potential
customer’s credit quality. The credit-worthiness of its customers are reviewed based
on their financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. Outstanding
customer receivables are reviewed periodically.
The credit risk related to the Trade receivables is mitigated by taking security deposits
/ bank guarantee / letter of credit / post dated negotiable instruments - as and where
considered necessary, setting appropriate credit terms and by setting and monitoring
internal limits on exposure to individual customers.
There is no substantial concentration of credit risk as the Revenue / Trade receivables
pertaining to any of the single external customer does not exceed 10% of Company
revenue.

The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on Trade
Receivables that is at amortised cost. Loss allowance in respect of financial assets
is measured at an amount equal to life time expected credit losses and is calculated
as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the expected
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other
receivables during the Year was as follows:

Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances/investments with banks and financial institutions is managed
in accordance with the Company’s treasury risk management policy. Investments of
surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within limits assigned
to each counterparty. The limits are assigned based on corpus of investable surplus
and corpus of the investment avenue. The limits are set to minimize the concentration
of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure
to make payments.

Financial guarantees
In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Company to banks and financial
institutions, the maximum exposure which the Company is exposed to is the maximum
amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based
on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that
it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees
provided.
ii)
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types
of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk
and commodity risk. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of
changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price
fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Financial instruments affected by
market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments.
(a)
Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all
recognised monetary assets and liabilities, which are denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency of the Company. The Company’s management
has set policy wherein exposure is identified, benchmark is set and monitored
closely, and accordingly suitable hedges are undertaken.
The Company’s foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange
imports and exports, primarily with respect to USD,JPY,AED & SGD.
As at the end of the reporting period, the carrying amounts of the company’s
foreign currency denominated monetary financial assets and financial liabilities
in respect of the foreign currencies are as follows:

(b)
Equity price risk
Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the
investments in equity securities. The fair value of some of the Company’s
investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to
changes in the market price of securities. The fair value of Company’s investment
in quoted equity securities as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 was
Rs. 7,65,591.04 lakhs and Rs. 3,32,554.89 lakhs respectively. A 10% change in
equity price as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 would result in an impact
of Rs. 76,559.10 lakhs and Rs. 33,255.49 lakhs respectively. The impact is
indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any.
(c)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates.
As the Company does not have exposure to any floating-interest bearing assets
or liabilities, or any significant long-term fixed-interest bearing assets, its interest
income / expenses and related cash inflows / outflows are not affected by
changes in market interest rates.

Interest rate risk (Continued)
The Company has investments in redeemable preference shares of joint ventures
and other companies. Future cash flows from these investments in the form of
dividends have fixed coupon rate and will not fluctuate due to changes in market
interest rates. However, the dividend distribution will be subject to availability
of adequate profits in the books of respective companies.
iii)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations.
The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure
that funds are available for use as per requirements.

consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The amount of

consideration received from customers while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified

term ranging from 1 to 5 years.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To
The Members of
Tata Industries Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Tata Industries Limited
(the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries, (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together
referred to as the “Group”), its associates and its joint ventures, which comprise the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary
of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as
“the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to
us, and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements
of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred to in the Other Matters section below,
the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies
Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with
the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the
Group, its associates and joint ventures as at 31 March 2024, and their consolidated loss and
other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes
in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities
under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group,
its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with these ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act
and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit
evidence obtained by us and other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in “Other
Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the consolidated financial statements.

Eightieth Annual Report

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other
information. The other information comprises the information included in the holding Company’s
annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed and based on the work/audit report of others auditors,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Managements and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation
and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the
Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial
performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated
changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance with
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Management and Board of
Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates and joint ventures and
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of
appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a
true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of
Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are
responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)

165
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to
liquidate the Company or cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates
and joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the
Group and of its associates and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on internal financial controls
with reference to the consolidated financial statements and the operating effectiveness
of such controls based on our audit.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of
Directors.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)

INDUSTRIES
Eightieth Annual Report

166
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events
or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to
continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
•
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of such
entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such
entities or business activities included in the consolidated financial statements of which
we are the independent auditor’s. For the other entities or business activities included
in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors,
such auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the
audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that,
individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and
in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements
in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such
other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent
auditor’s regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.

have not been audited by us. These financial statements have been audited by other
auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion

countries. The Holding Company’s management has converted the financial statements
of such subsidiaries located outside India from accounting principles generally accepted
in their respective countries to accounting principles generally accepted in India. We
have audited these conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management.
Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiaries located
outside India is based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments
prepared by the management of the Holding Company and audited by us.
b)
The financial statements of three (3) step-down subsidiaries, whose financial statements
reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 85,860 lakhs as at 31 March

Outflows amounting (before consolidation adjustments) to Rs. 1,711 lakhs for the year
ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements, have not

included in respect of these step-down subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-sections
(3) of Section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid step-down subsidiaries,
is based solely on such unaudited financial statements/financial information. In our opinion
and according to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, this
financial statements/financial information are not material to the Group.
c)

the consolidated financial statements, have not been considered in the consolidated

ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
(Referred to in paragraph (A) (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’
section of our report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls over financial reporting under Clause (i) of
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Tata Industries Limited
(the “Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the Holding Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Holding Company’s management and the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls over financial
reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence
to Holding Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013
(hereinafter referred to as “the Act”).
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal
financial controls over financial reporting and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under
Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and
maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the
internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

INDUSTRIES
Eightieth Annual Report
Tata Industries Limited
172
ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (Continued)
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial controls with reference
to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over financial reporting with reference to
consolidated financial statements
A Holding Company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Holding company’s internal
financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Holding
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Holding company are being made only
in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Holding company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Holding company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with reference
to consolidated financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with
reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial
reporting with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to
the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company
as of and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements of Tata Industries Limited (hereinafter
referred to as “the Holding Company”) and such companies incorporated in India under the
Companies Act, 2013 which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and its

1.
Background
Tata Industries Limited (‘TIL’) was incorporated on April 7, 1945 at Mumbai under the
Companies Act, VII of 1913 and has been carrying on the business of an investment
holding company engaged in the incubation / promotion of new business ventures.
From April 2012 onwards, TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company (‘CIC’) by
the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on account of its investments being made prominently
in other Tata companies. Earlier, it was registered with RBI as a Non-Banking Financial
Company.
Besides carrying out investment activities from Head office, TIL has three operating
divisions engaged into management consultancy, data analytics business and healthcare
solutions.
These are the consolidated financial statements of TIL and its subsidiaries (collectively
“the Group”) and joint ventures and associate companies are mentioned in Note 56 of
the financials.
The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2024 and authorised for issue on 03 May 2024.

Summary of statement of compliance, basis of preparation and presentation, critical
accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation
A.
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements (‘CFS’) comply, in all material aspects,
with Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) notified under Section 133 of the
Companies Act, 2013 (‘the 2013 Act’) read with Rule 3 of Companies (Indian
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
B.
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR),
which is also TIL’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded-off to the
nearest lakhs, unless otherwise indicated.
C.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods
and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

D.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the
Company, its subsidiaries and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates
as at the reporting date.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries include all the entities over which the Group has control. The Group
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns
through its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The Company
reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements listed above.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date
control ceases.
Inter-company transactions and balances including unrealised profits are
eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated
subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company’s equity. The interest of
non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at
the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total
comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results
in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of
control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the
Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the
changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the
amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of
the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed
to owners of the Company.
When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is
calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of

consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the
previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the
subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e.,
reclassified to profit or loss) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant
assets or liabilities were disposed off. The fair value of any investment retained
in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair
value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind-AS 109 Financial
Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment
in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control
of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The results
assets and liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in these financial statements
using the equity method of accounting.
A Joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint
control. Joint control is considered when there is contractually agreed sharing of
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Investments
in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint venture. The
classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor,
rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. A joint operation is a joint
arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have
rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control
of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy
decisions of the investee but not control or joint control those policies. Significant
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent
of the voting power of another entity. The results, assets and liabilities of associates
are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of
accounting.

Equity method of accounting (equity accounted investees)
An interest in an associate or joint venture is accounted for using the equity method
from the date in which the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture and
are recognised initially at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated
financial statements include the Group’s share of profits or losses and equity
movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence
or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control
ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity
accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term
investments in the nature of net investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Dividend received or receivable from associates and joint-ventures are recognised
as a reduction in carrying amount of the investment.
The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment
in accordance with the policy described in Note 2E below.
Changes in the proportion held by NCI
Changes in the proportion of the equity held by NCI are accounted for as equity
transactions. The carrying amount of the controlling interests and NCI are adjusted
to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference
between the amount by which the NCI are adjusted and the fair value of the
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to
owners of the Group.
E.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised and future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year are discussed below:
(i)
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets
and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised.
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule
II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different
from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on technical advice,
considering the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the
operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and maintenance support.
Assumptions also need to be made, when the Group assesses, whether an
asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset
may be capitalised.
(ii)
Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan and other long-term
employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions. Key
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and
vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on
government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds
correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit
obligations.
(iii)
Recognition of deferred tax assets
Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of
deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing
and the level of future taxable profits.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected
future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change.
(iv)
Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its
fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of completion method requires
the Group to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion
of the total efforts or costs to be expended. Efforts or costs expended have
been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct
relationship between input and productivity.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are
recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the
expected contract estimates at the reporting date.
(v)
Impairment of trade receivables
The Group reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular
intervals. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
receivables. In determining whether impairment losses should be reported
in the statement of profit and loss, the Group makes judgments as to whether
there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease
in the estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, an allowance for expected
credit loss is made where there is an identified loss event or condition which,
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability
of the cash flows.
(vi)
Impairment losses on investments
The Group reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised
cost annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment
loss is accounted for.
F.
Measurement of fair values
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair
values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement
of fair values, which includes overseeing all significant fair value measurement,
including level 3 fair values by the management. The management regularly reviews
significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information,
such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure fair values, then the
management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support
the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including
the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.
When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Group
uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into
different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques as follows:
Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
from prices).
Level 3 : inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised
in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input
that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers
between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during
which the change has occurred.

Foreign currency translation
On initial recognition, all foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the
transaction. As at the reporting date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the
exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Financial instruments
(i)
Investments and other financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement
categories:
i)
those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other
comprehensive income (‘OCI’), or through profit and loss), and
ii)
those measured at amortised cost
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the
financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets
measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in statement
of profit and loss or OCI. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend
on the business model in which the investment is held. For investment in
equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Group has made an
irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity
investment at fair value through OCI.
The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business
model for managing those assets changes.
Debt instruments
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value
plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss,
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit
or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Subsequent measurement of debt
instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset
and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement
categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:
Amortised cost
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured
at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently
measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is
recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired.
Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income
using the effective interest rate method.
3.
Significant accounting policies (Continued)

189
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
Fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’)
Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling
the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’). Movements in the carrying amount are
taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses,
interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised
in Statement of Profit and Loss. When the financial asset is derecognised,
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from
equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ (losses) within other income
or other expense. Interest income from these financial assets is included in
other income using the effective interest rate method.
Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are
measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt
investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part of a
hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the
Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/(losses) within other income or other
expense in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial
assets is included in other income.
Equity instruments
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where
the Group’s management has elected to present fair value gains and losses
on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair
value gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from
such investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as
Other Income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as
gains/(losses) within other income or other expense in the Statement of
Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on
equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from
other changes in fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily
convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant

risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or
less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for
withdrawal and usage.
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised only when the Group
•
has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset;
or
•
retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial
assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to
one or more recipients.
Where the Group transfers an asset, it evaluates whether it has transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. Where
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership,
the financial asset is derecognised. Where the Group has not transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the
financial asset is not derecognised. Where the Group has neither transferred
a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership
of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has
not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control
of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent
of continuing involvement in the financial asset.
(i)
Debt and equity instruments (liabilities)
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments
issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs.
(ii)
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and
other liabilities. These are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction
costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost
of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or,
where appropriate, a shorter period.
Changes to the carrying amount of a financial liability as a result of
renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of
the financial liability, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, its
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
(iii)
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency
exposures. Derivative instruments are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and
changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge
the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast
transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. At inception
of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group
also documents the economic relationship between hedged item and
hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the
hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.
Cash Flow Hedge
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the
effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives is
recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under ‘ effective
portion of cash flow hedges’. The effective portion of the changes in the fair
value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedge item, determined on a present value basis,
from the inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of the changes in
the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss.

The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in
the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash
flows affect profit and loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging
instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then the hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. When the hedge accounting for
cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated
in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods
as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the
amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately
reclassified in profit and loss.
(iv)
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group on a case to case basis elects to account for financial guarantee
contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract, as specified
in Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments and Ind AS 104 on Insurance
Contracts. The Group has regarded all its financial guarantee contracts as
insurance contracts. At the end of each reporting period the Group performs
a liability adequacy test, (i.e. it assesses the likelihood of a pay-out based
on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows), and any deficiency
is recognized in profit or loss.
(v)
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a
legally enforceable right (not contingent on future events) to off-set the
recognised amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis,
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
C.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and measurement
All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost of
acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as
a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item
can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for

as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and
maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period
in which they are incurred.
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises
the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing
the item to working condition for its intended use, and estimated costs of
dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.
Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is
recognised in profit or loss.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress
account. At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended
by management, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category
of property, plant and equipment. Costs associated with the commissioning of an
asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and
the asset is ready for its intended use.
Depreciation on tangible fixed assets of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries
and associates has been provided on Straight Line Method (SLM), considering
the useful lives and residual value prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies
Act, 2013 except in respect of the following categories of assets, in whose case
the life of the assets has been assessed as under based on technical advice,
taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the
operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated
technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support:

a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses, if any.
Amortisation
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life on straight line
basis as follows:

Research and development expenses
Revenue expenses pertaining to research is charged to the consolidated statement
of profit and loss. Development cost of products are also charged to consolidated
statement of profit and loss unless a product’s technical feasibility has been
established, in which case such expenditure is capitalized. The amount capitalized
comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable
and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its
intended use. Fixed assets utilized for research and development are capitalized
and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for the property, plant and
equipment.
E.
Investment property
Recognition and measurement
Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital
appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use
in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
Upon initial recognition, an investment property is measured at cost, including
related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property
is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.
Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when
it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected
from its disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property (calculated
as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount
of the item) is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably.
Depreciation
Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice, the management believes
a period of 60 years representing the best estimate of the period over which
investment property (which is quite similar) is expected to be used. Accordingly,
the company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a
straight-line basis.

Reclassification from / to investment property
Transfers to (or from) investment property are made only when there is a change
in use. Transfers between investment property, owner-occupied property and
inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and
they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure
purposes.
Fair value disclosure
The fair values of investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values is
determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant
professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category
of the investment property being valued.
F.
Inventories
Stock-in-trade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make
the sale. Cost of traded goods is determined on First-in-First out (FIFO) basis and
includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. The comparison of cost and net realizable
value is made on an item by item basis. Provision is made for the cost of
obsolescence and other anticipated losses, whenever considered necessary.
G.
Impairment
Impairment of financial instruments (other than at fair value)
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated
with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The
impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Group applies the simplified
approach permitted by Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, which requires expected
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date
are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication of such impairment exists, the recoverable amount of
such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount
of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, an impairment is recognised.
3.
Significant accounting policies (Continued)
E.
Investment property (Continued)

197
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in
use. Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present
value based on an appropriate discount factor. Assessment is also done at each
Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss
recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have
decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of
Profit and Loss.
H.
Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are
classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily
through sale rather than through continuing use.
Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resultant loss on a disposal
group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on
pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets,
deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, and biological assets, which continue
to be measured in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Losses
on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on re-
measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated.
I.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service
are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include
compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of
short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services
rendered by employees is recognised during the year.
Defined Contribution plans
The Group makes monthly contributions to the Superannuation fund and National
pension scheme for all qualifying employees, until retirement or resignation of the
employee. The Group recognizes such contributions as an expense when incurred.
The Group has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.

Defined benefit plans
The Group operates the post-employment schemes such as Gratuity, Provident
fund and Post-retirement medical benefits (PRMB) and Pension to an ex-director
which are defined benefit plans.
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit
plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated
annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for
measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method.
This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee to
employees. Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans, since the
Group is obliged to meet interest shortfall, if any, with respect to covered
employees.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting
the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the
reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms
of the related obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance
of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. This cost
is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur,
directly in the other comprehensive income.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan
amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service
cost.
Other long-term employee benefits
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly
after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services.
They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to
be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting
period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using
the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating

to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurement as a result of experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement
of profit and loss.
Other long-term employee benefits (Continued)
The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting
period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.
J.
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows
(representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating
losses are not provided for.
A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to
be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost
of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract
is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before
such a provision is made, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets
associated with that contract.
K.
Revenue recognition
The Group has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which
establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and
when revenue is to be recognised.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in
exchange for those products or services.
The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
3.

Employee benefits (Continued)

INDUSTRIES
Eightieth Annual Report
Tata Industries Limited

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach
to revenue recognition:
•
Step 1 : Identify the contract(s) with a customer
•
Step 2 : Identify the performance obligation in contract
•
Step 3 : Determine the transaction price
•
Step 4 : Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
•
Step 5 : Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation
Under Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance
obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the
particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Rendering of services
In respect of contracts, other than ClassEdge license and support fees, revenue
on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the related services are
performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date is
recognized as unbilled revenue. Revenue from fixed-price, fixed-timeframe
contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and where
there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is
recognized as per the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended
have been used to measure progress towards completion. Projected losses, if
any, are provided in entirety as per Ind AS based on management’s current
estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of technical assessment
of time and effort required and estimates of future expenditure.
Revenue from licensing of ClassEdge content to schools is recognized, on a pro-
rata basis over the contract period, commensurate with the services rendered /
cost incurred for the same. The Group has applied the guidance in Ind AS 115
by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance
obligation. The arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for
considering equipment, software licenses and support services as distinct
performance obligations. The performance obligations are satisfied as and when
the services are rendered since the customer consumes the services as time
progresses.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration,
adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price
concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer.
Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.
Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets (which are referred
to as unbilled revenue) while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as
contract liabilities (which are referred to as unearned revenues).
Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings
on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of
invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only
passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are
billings in excess of revenues.
Revenue from After School (AFS) License subscription consist of subscription
fees charged for subscription-based online educational content.
Content subscription fee is received in advance and is record as deferred revenue.
Revenue is recognized uniformly over the contract period as the subscription
services represent a obligation to provide the services while the customer
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of such services throughout
the contract period.
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods
to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns (if any), trade discounts, rebates,
and goods and service tax.
Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract.
Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of
the customer contract, except in case where the amortisation period is one year
or less, in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred.
Interest income
Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest
rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross
carrying amount of a financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate,

the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual
terms of the financial instruments (for example, prepayment, extension) but does
not consider the expected credit loss.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group’s
right to receive payment is established.
L.
Leases
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease
separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative
stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of
the non-lease components.
The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-
of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial
direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in
dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset
or site on which it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured
at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if
any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use
assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date
over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated
useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of
property, plant and equipment.
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication
that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments
that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses
incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics,
the Company, on a lease by lease basis, may adopt either the incremental
borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the
portfolio as a whole.
The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual
value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is
reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating
the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate
the lease.
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount
to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any
reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease
payments.
The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an
adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement
of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-
measurement in statement of profit and loss.
The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to short-term
leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for
which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with
these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
Group as a lessor
At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an
operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received
under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term.
In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based
on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net
investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for

its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from
the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a
short term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then
it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies
Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract.
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning
April 1, 2019 and applied the standard to its leases, retrospectively, with the
cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard, recognised on the date of initial
application (April 1, 2019). Accordingly, the Company has not restated comparative
information, instead, the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard has
been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
as on April 1, 2019.
The Group has applied the Covid -19 related concession – amendment to Ind AS
116. The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior
periods and will affect the current & future periods only.
M.
Income Tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss
except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or to an item
recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income
or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect
of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax
amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any,
related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise
the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is also recognised
in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax is not
recognised for:
•
temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities
in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
•
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and
joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing
of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
•
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. The existence of
unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available.
Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Group recognises a deferred
tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or
there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available
against which such deferred tax asset can be realised. Deferred tax assets-
unrecognised or recognised, are reviewed at each reporting date and are
recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable
respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow
from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable right to
offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by
the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but
they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax
assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the
criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new
information about facts and circumstances change. Acquired deferred tax benefits
recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill related to that
acquisition if they result from new information obtained about facts and
circumstances existing at the acquisition date. If the carrying amount of goodwill
is zero, any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve

Discontinued Operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations
and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the
Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations and

is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of
business or geographic area of operations; or
•
is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the

When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative
statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the operation had been
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange differences
relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an
adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset
which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended
use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are
recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s Board to make decisions

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year
attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity

and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Business combinations
Business combinations under common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under
the common control are accounted in accordance with “Pooling of Interest Method”
laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 (Ind AS 103) Business
combinations of entities under common control, notified under the Companies
Act, 2013.
All assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books
of account of the Group at their existing carrying amounts. Inter-company balances
are eliminated. The difference, between the investments held by the Group and
all assets, liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recognised in capital
reserve and presented separately from other capital reserves. Comparative
accounting period presented in the financial statements of the Group has been
restated for the accounting impact of the merger, as stated above, as if the merger
had occurred from the beginning of the comparative period in the financial
statements.
Any non-controlling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets.
This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis.

Business combinations not under common control
Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate
of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities
assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they
are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities
assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host
contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at
fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset
or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial
Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in
profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109,
it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and
subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests,
and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the
aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly
identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews
the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition
date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets
acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised

in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear
evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as
capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the
reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional
amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional
amounts are adjusted through goodwill during the measurement period, or
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. These adjustments are
called as measurement period adjustments. The measurement period does not
exceed one year from the acquisition date.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination,
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to
those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its
carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the
unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment
loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed
operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining
the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the
cash-generating unit retained.

Significant accounting policies (Continued)
R.
Business combinations (Continued)
The excess of the consideration transferred, amount of the non-controlling interest,
and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest is the acquired entity
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
S.
Provisions and contingencies
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of
past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate of the amount can be
made. Provisions are determined based on best estimate required to settle the
obligation at the Balance Sheet date. When a provision is measured using the
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the
present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of the money
is material). The increase in the provisions due to passage of time is recognized
as interest expense. Provisions are reviewed as at each reporting date and adjusted
to reflect the current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising
from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the
control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where
it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or
a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
Contingent assets are not disclosed in the financial statements unless an inflow
of economic benefits is probable.

Segment reporting
A.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities
from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and for which discrete financial
information is available. Operating results of all operating segments are reviewed regularly
by the management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments
and assess their performance.
The Company has seven reportable segments and two reported segments, as described
below, which are the Company’s strategic business units. These business units offer
different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different
technology and marketing strategies. For each of the business units, the Company’s
management reviews internal management reports on at least a monthly basis.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable /

B.
Measurement of fair values
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent
to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:
Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists
of investment in quoted equity shares.
Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This level of
hierarchy includes derivative contracts.
Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined
in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument
nor are they based on available market data. This level of hierarchy includes investments
in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.
C.
Valuation technique to determine fair value
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial
instruments:
(i)
Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
receivables, loans (measured at amortised cost), trade and other payables,
borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying
value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair
values due to their predominant short term nature.
(ii)
Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price
quotations as on 31 March. Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been
considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of
possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value
within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.

(Currency: Indian rupees in lakhs)
Instead, they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose. Upon the application
of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity
instruments at FVOCI as the directors believes this provides a more meaningful
presentation for medium or long term strategic investments, than reflecting changes
in fair value immediately in profit or loss.
(iii)
Investments in unquoted shares carried at fair value are based on discounted cash
flow approach. The valuation model considers the present value of expected cash
inflows, discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
(iv)
Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial
instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
(v)
There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the year ended March
31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

Financial Risk Management
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
- credit risk;
- market risk; and
- liquidity risk
Risk management framework
The Company’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and
oversight of the risk management framework. The Company’s management is responsible
for developing and monitoring the risk management policies.
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the
risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor
risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The
Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to
maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees
understand their roles and obligations.
The Company’s Board of Directors oversees how management monitors compliance with
the Company’s risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of

263
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024
(Currency: Indian rupees in lakhs)
the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Board
of Directors is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes
both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results
of which are reported to the Board of Directors.
The Board has setup a Risk Management Committee comprising of Directors, Key
Managerial Personnel, CEOs of the business divisions apart from Chief Risk Officer.
Risk Management Committee oversees the Company’s risk management process and
controls, reviews strategic plans and objectives for risk management, risk philosophy
and risk optimisation, reviews compliance with risk management policies implemented
by the Company and procedures used to implement the same, oversights various risks
including credit risk, financial & operational risks, technology risk, market risk, liquidity
risk, investment risk, cyber security risk, forex risk, commodity risk, Company’s risk
tolerance, capital liquidity and funding.
The Board has setup a Asset Liability Management Committee comprising of Directors,
Key Managerial Personnel, Chief Risk Officer and Senior Personnel at Head Office.
Asset Liability Management Committee reviews asset liability mismatch, if any, debt
composition and plan of the Company for fund raising of the Company.
i)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a
financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from
the Group’s receivables from customers, loans and investments in debt securities.The
carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables of the Company are typically unsecured and derived from sales made
to a large number of independent customers. Customer credit risk is managed by each
business unit subject to established policies, procedures and control relating to customer
credit risk management. Before accepting any new customer, the Company has
appropriate level of control procedures to assess the potential customer’s credit quality.
The credit-worthiness of its customers are reviewed based on their financial position,
past experience and other relevant factors. Outstanding customer receivables are reviewed
periodically.
The credit risk related to the Trade receivables is mitigated by taking security deposits
/ bank guarantee / letter of credit / post dated negotiable instruments - as and where
considered necessary, setting appropriate credit terms and by setting and monitoring
internal limits on exposure to individual customers.

Credit risk (Continued)
The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on Trade Receivables
that is at amortised cost. Loss allowance in respect of financial assets is measured at an
amount equal to life time expected credit losses and is calculated as the difference between
their carrying amount and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted
at the original effective interest rate.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables
during the year was as follows:
There is no substantial concentration of credit risk as the Revenue / Trade receivables
pertaining to any single external customer does not exceed 10% of Group’s revenue.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables
during the year was as follows:

Financial Risk Management (Continued)
i)
Credit risk (Continued)
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances/investments with banks and financial institutions is managed
in accordance with the Company’s treasury risk management policy. Investments of surplus
funds are made only with approved counterparties and within limits assigned to each
counterparty. The limits are assigned based on corpus of investable surplus and corpus
of the investment avenue. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and
therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
Financial guarantees
In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Group to banks and financial institutions,
the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum amount which
the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation
at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that
such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.
ii)
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk:
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity
risk. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market
changes. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,
deposits, investments and derivative financial instruments.
(a)
Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises on future commercial transactions and on all recognised
monetary assets and liabilities, which are denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the Group. The Group’s management has set policy wherein
exposure is identified, benchmark is set and monitored closely, and accordingly
suitable hedges are undertaken.
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises mainly from foreign exchange
imports and exports, primarily with respect to USD, EURO, SGD, AED, CHF, HUF,
JPY and GBP.

(b)
Equity price risk
Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments
in equity securities. The fair value of some of the Company’s investments measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income exposes the Company to equity
price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price of securities.
The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as at 31 March
2024 and 31 March 2023 was Rs. 7,65,591.04 lakhs and Rs. 3,32,554.89 lakhs
respectively. A 10% change in equity price as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023
would result in an impact of Rs. 76,559.10 lakhs and Rs. 33,255.49 lakhs respectively.
The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any.
(c)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates.
As the Group does not have exposure to any floating-interest bearing assets or
liabilities, or any significant long-term fixed-interest bearing assets, its interest income
/ expenses and related cash inflows / outflows are not affected by changes in market
interest rates.
The Group has investments in redeemable preference shares of joint ventures,
associates and other companies. Future cash flows from these investments in the
form of dividends have fixed coupon rate and will not fluctuate due to changes in
market interest rates. However, the dividend distribution will be subject to availability
of adequate profits in the books of respective companies.
iii)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations. The
objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that
funds are available for use as per requirements.
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting
date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments,
if any:
