MESSAGE FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN

Mr. Neeraj Swaroop

Chairman, HDFC Securities Limited

Dear Shareholders,

As  HDFC  Securities  completes  its  25th  year,  we  find 
ourselves  at  a  pivotal  moment  in  India’s  financial 
history-where  the  convergence  of  robust  economic 
growth,  technological  innovation,  and  deepening 
financial inclusion has reshaped the very contours of 
capital markets. What began in 2000 as a traditional 
broking house anchored in relationship-driven equity 
advice  has,  over  a  quarter  century,  evolved  into  a 
full-spectrum  financial  powerhouse  that  seamlessly 
integrates  research,  advisory  services,  distribution, 
and discount broking under one digital roof.

This financial year stands out as a landmark year that 
crystallises  this  transformation.  On  the  macro  front, 
India’s economy outpaced most peers, sustaining real 
GDP  growth  north  of  6%  even  as  global  headwinds 
intensified in the later part of the year. This environment 
not only propelled benchmark indices to record highs 
but  also  catalysed  a  generational  shift  in  savings 
behaviour:  a  surge  of  first-time  investors,  increasing 
liquidity,  and  a  burgeoning  appetite  for  equities  and 
structured products.

the  discount  broking 

Simultaneously, 
revolution 
continues  to  surge.  All-in-one  mobile  platforms 
democratized  market  access,  empowering  everyday 
Indians-from  students  and  salaried  professionals  to 
entrepreneurs-to  trade,  invest,  and  learn  at  minimal 
cost.  Yet,  low  fees  alone  do  not  suffice.  Clients  now 
demand  institutional-grade  research,  cutting-edge 
analytics,  and  frictionless  execution-capabilities  that 
define  HDFC  Securities’  HDFC  SKY  offering,  where 
flat  brokerage  meets  proprietary  insights  and  expert 
guidance

Parallel  to  this  democratization,  the  High-Net-Worth 
Individual (HNI) segment experienced unprecedented 
growth.  With  average  household  wealth  on  the  rise, 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com2

discerning clients sought bespoke advisory solutions-
multiclass  asset  allocation,  alternative  investments, 
and  legacy-planning  services.  Our  dedicated  HNI 
desk,  fortified  by  a  team  of  chartered  analysts  and 
relationship advisors, has been instrumental in crafting 
portfolios that balance growth with risk mitigation.

record  retail  participation,  soaring  trading  volumes, 
regulatory  enhancements,  and  the  twin  pillars  of 
discount  broking  and  HNI  wealth  advisory.  It  also 
charts  our  strategic  roadmap,  reaffirming  HDFC 
Securities’  commitment 
to  democratizing  capital 
markets while delivering differentiated value to every 
investor we serve.

Against  this  dynamic  backdrop,  the  ensuing  forward 
delves into the key themes that shaped FY 2024–25, 

MACROECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS: A BULLISH BACKDROP

•  India’s economy exhibited enviable resilience 

through FY 2024–25:

•   The  RBI  held  its  policy  repo  rate  at  6.50%  until 
Dec  2024,  before  cutting  it  by  25  bps  in  Feb 
2025, followed by another 25 bps cut in Apr 2025, 
bringing it down to 6.00%.

$14.6 Billion

•   Foreign Flows: Foreign portfolio investors turned 
net sellers in FY 2024–25, withdrawing about US 
$14.6 billion.

Building  on  our  resilient  macro  backdrop,  we  will  now  pivot  from  consolidation  to  acceleration-streamlining 
our digital platforms, deepening client engagement across segments, and forging new partnerships to capture 
emerging opportunities. By staying agile, enhancing risk management, and fostering innovation, we’ll ensure 
that HDFC Securities not only rides the upward momentum but also shapes the next phase of India’s growth 
story.

UNPRECEDENTED RETAIL PARTICIPATION

One of the most striking developments was the deepening of India’s retail investor base:

 Surge in Demat Accounts: 

Across the Indian securities market, total active demat 
accounts now exceed 19 crore, up from roughly 15.5 
crore a year ago.

 Tier-II & III Growth: 

Notably,  nearly  45%  of  new  accounts  originated 
from  non-metro  regions,  signalling  the  spread  of 
financial inclusion beyond traditional urban centres.

First-Time Investors: 

Over  30 lakh  of  these  entrants  were  first-time 
investors,  drawn  with  the  interest  towards  wealth 
creation,  digital  ease,  and  curated  advisory  solutions 
tailored to new users.

This  democratization  of  market  access  underscores  a  powerful  societal  shift:  savings  once  confined  to  fixed-
income avenues are increasingly being seeded in equities, ETFs, and mutual funds-setting the stage for decades 
of compounded wealth creation.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com4

RECORD TRADING  
VOLUMES & REVENUE 
GROWTH

Buoyed by rising participation, trading activity across 
segments scaled new heights:

•   EquityCashTurnover: HDFC Securities aggregate 
cash  equity  turnover  crossed  `7.69 lakh crore, 
marking a 20% increase over FY 2023–24 

•   Revenue: HDFC Securities reported a totalincome
of  `3,265  crore,  reflecting  a  23% year-on-year
(YoY)  increase.  Net  revenue  (total  income  less 
finance  costs)  surged  20% YoY to `2,479  crore. 
The company’s Profit After Tax (PAT) grew 18%
YoYto`1,125 crore.

These figures not only reaffirm the market’s vibrancy 
but  also  highlight  the  critical  role  of  technology  in 
enabling seamless scalability-from handling surges in 
daily orders to delivering sub-second price updates to 
millions of devices.

WAY FORWARD

As we celebrate 25 years of pioneering India’s capital 
markets, our goal is clear: convert every technological 
advance  and  market  reform  into  real,  measurable 
gains for Indian investors and traders. Looking ahead, 
by  embedding  smart  analytics  into  simple  interfaces 
and  by  tailoring  wealth-building  pathways,  HDFC 
Securities  will  remain  the  architect  of  the  financial 
journey of Indian investors.

A MESSAGE FROM 
THE MD & CEO

Mr.DhirajRelli

Managing Director & CEO, HDFC Securities Limited

Dear Shareholders,

As  we  celebrate  25  years  of  pioneering  growth 
and  transformation,  our  journey  from  one  of  India’s 
first  online  stockbroking  firms  to  a  truly  digital-first 
investment  platform  has  been  powered  by  relentless 
innovation.  Our  products  -  InvestRight,  an  RM-
managed  investment  app,    HDFC  SKY,  our  mobile-
first discount broking platform with zero brokerage on 
ETFs;  and  HDFC  TRU,  our  bespoke  wealth  advisory 
solution for HNIs and corporates - are reimagining the 
investing experience for over 6.8 million customers.

innovation  translated 

In  FY  2024–25,  this 
into 
robust  financial  performance:  profit  after  tax  rose  18 
percent  YoY  to  `1,125  crore,  total  income  increased 
23 percent to `3,265 crore, and equity trade volumes 
surged 20 percent to `7.69 lakh crore. This milestone 
year  underscores  our  unwavering  commitment  to 
democratizing wealth creation and sets the stage for 
the next quarter-century of growth.

infrastructure 

At the same time, India maintained its position as the 
world’s fastest-growing major economy, with real GDP 
expanding  6.5  percent  in  FY  2024–25-buoyed  by  a 
strong  7.4  percent  uptick  in  Q4,  driven  by  resilient 
domestic  demand  and 
investment.  
Even  Corporate  India    delivered  record  earnings, 
as  the  top  500  companies  posted  a  combined  `15 
lakh  crore  in  net  profit-a  historic  milestone  that 
underscores  broad-based  corporate  resilience.  This 
powerful  convergence  of  our  own  market  leadership 
and India’s macroeconomic dynamism sets the stage 
for our vision: the equitisation of savings - shifting vast 
household  deposits  into  equities-pioneering  next-
generation  digital  experiences,  and  extending  our 
reach  into  emerging  markets,  ensuring  every  Indian 
can participate in and benefit from the nation’s long-
term growth story.

DIGITAL ADOPTION &  
MARKET TRENDS

1.SurgeinPassive &Market-LinkedProducts

The  shift  from  traditional  savings  to  market-linked 
instruments  has  accelerated:  in  this  financial  year, 
passive funds (equity ETFs and index funds) attracted 
a  combined  `1.40  lakh  crore  in  net  inflows-equity 
ETFs alone saw a 121 percent jump YoY to `66,000 
crore, while equity index funds grew 163 percent to 
`65,000 crore . Assets under management in Indian 
ETFs climbed from `5.1 trillion in May 2024 to over 
`8 trillion by March 2025, with April 2025 marking 
the  highest-ever  monthly  ETF  inflows  of  `19,056 
crore .

As  I  wrote  in  an  article  earlier  this  year,  Gen  Z’s 
investment ethos is built on value, transparency and 
control-and ETFs deliver exactly that, driving record 
inflows  and  reshaping  the  retail  equity  landscape. 
Their digital-first mindset has prompted us to roll out 
zero-fee ETF offering, and seamless on-boarding on 
HDFC SKY, ensuring a  best-in-class experience for 
this fast-growing segment

2.TheRiseofMarginTradingFacility(MTF)

climbed 

I  have  witnessed  margin  trading  evolve  into  a 
mainstream tool for calibrated market participation. 
Industry-wide  MTF  balances 
from 
approximately  `50,000  crore  in  March  2024  to  a 
peak  of  `85,000  crore  in  September  2024-before 
stabilizing around `75,000 crore by February 2025 
as volatility eased. This trend reflects a maturing retail 
segment that now employs 2-4x leverage prudently 
to  enhance  capital  efficiency  and  participate  more 
dynamically in market moves.

To meet this demand, we offer up to 4x leverage on 
both HDFC SKY and InvestRight platforms, enabling 
investors to “buy stocks now, pay later” with margin 
loans  held  for  up  to  T+275  days.  Complementing 
this  powerful  capital-efficiency  tool,  our  in-house 
research  team  provides  actionable  equity  and  ETF 
recommendations-ensuring  clients  can 
leverage 
insights as they optimize exposure and manage risk.

At  HDFC  Securities,  our  dedicated  research  team 
brings 25 years of market-cycle experience, applying 
rigorous  fundamental  and  technical  analysis  to 
develop timely market insights .

We integrate these proprietary insights directly into 
our  digital  offerings  -  HDFC  SKY  and  InvestRight. 
Clients  receive  daily  expert  calls,  weekly  thematic 
strategies  and  monthly  outlooks,  ensuring  each 
investment  decision  is  data-driven  and  aligned 
with  evolving  market  dynamics  .  For  those  seeking 
a  personalized  approach,  InvestRight  couples  this 
research with dedicated Relationship Managers who 
tailor equity and ETF recommendations to individual 
goals and risk profiles .

This  seamless  blend  of  deep  domain  expertise, 
cutting-edge  digital  delivery  and  one-on-one 
support  sets  HDFC  Securities  apart.  It  underpins 
our  commitment  to  the  equitisation  of  savings, 
empowering  every 
trader 
or  advisory  client-to  build  resilient  portfolios  with 
confidence and clarity.

LAUNCH OF HDFC TRU: 
TAILORED WEALTH ADVISORY 
FOR HNIS & CORPORATES

In  October  2024,  we  ‘formally’  entered  the  wealth 
advisory  space  with  HDFC  TRU-our  dedicated 
platform for corporate treasuries, family offices and 
ultra-HNIs with over `50 crore in deployable assets”. 
We  offer  a  Comprehensive  product  suite  across 
Equity Advisory, Mutual Funds, Private Markets, Real 
Estate,  Global  Investments,  PMS/AIF,  Commodities 
etc.  This  diverse  scope  ensures  clients  can  access 
the full spectrum of asset classes-all under one roof-
eliminating the need to juggle multiple providers.

PROSPr Approach & Proprietary Expertise

At  its  core,  HDFC  TRU  is  powered  by  our  PROSPr 
framework-a  process-oriented  methodology  that 
combines:

-    Deep Domain Expertise: Decades of market-cycle

This  new  capability  positions  HDFC  Securities  as

must  extend  to  every  segment-from  the  first-time 
retail trader to the institutional treasury.

EQUITISATION OF SAVINGS:

I believe the true democratization of wealth lies not 
merely  in  financializing  savings,  but  in  equitising 
them-shifting capital from low-yield deposit vehicles 
into  market-linked 
that  drive  real 
growth. By making equities accessible through low-
cost ETFs, systematic investment plans and tailored 
margin strategies, we transform passive savers into 
active  stakeholders  in  India’s  economic  ascent. 
This  journey-from  parking  funds  at  near-zero  rates 
to  building  diversified  equity  portfolios-empowers 
every  household  to  outpace  inflation,  participate 
in  corporate  India’s  success  and  catalyze  deeper 
market  liquidity.  At  HDFC  Securities,  our  seamless

every  rupee  saved  becomes  a  building  block  of

LOOKING AHEAD: THE 
FUTURE OF INDIA’S CAPITAL 
MARKETS

the  achievements  of  FY 
As  we  build  on 
2024–25-equity  volumes  crossing  `7.69 
lakh 
crore,  ETF  assets  eclipsing  `8  trillion  and  MTF 
balances  averaging  over  `75,000  crore-it  is  clear 
that India’s capital markets are entering a phase of 
unprecedented  depth  and  sophistication.  Over  the 
next decade, three forces will define this evolution. 
First,  hyper-digitization  and  AI  will  enable  truly 
personalized 
investing:  real-time  risk  analytics, 
dynamic  portfolio  rebalancing  and  voice-driven 
trade execution will become table stakes rather than 
elite  offerings.  Second,  regulatory  innovation-from 
T+0 settlement to on-exchange trading of tokenized 
fund  units-will  compress  liquidity  cycles,  lower 
transaction  costs  and  usher  in  new  categories  of 
market-linked instruments, broadening the range of 
choices for every kind of investor. Third, geographic 
and  demographic  inclusion  will  accelerate:  Tier 
2/3  towns  will  no  longer  trail  metros  in  access  or 
sophistication, as low-cost mobile platforms deliver 
the  same 
research,  margin 
facilities  and  thematic  baskets  to  every  pocket  in 
India.

institutional-grade 

At HDFC Securities, we are not just observers of this 
transformation-we are its architects. We will lead this 
transformation  by  scaling  our  digital  infrastructure, 
broadening  our  AI-driven  advisory  capabilities  and 
extending  our  research-backed  wealth  solutions-
ensuring  that  every  Indian  can  confidently  convert 
savings into long-term wealth.

INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES - 
A YEAR OF FINE EXECUTION

The three verticals of the Institutional team have been 
invested into, continuously, for whole of the past year. 
The motivation is sustained on an everyday basis. This 
is how the business is managed, and this is how it is 
grown.

As  we  had  informed  last  year,  fruits  of  trees  well 
planted  are  reaped  for  a  long  time  to  come.  The 
sustained  investments  in  the  Institutional  Equities  is 
reaping such proverbial fruits : our secondary market 
revenue was up ~ 30%, y-o-y. No mean achievement, 
when  the  overall  markets,  as  represented  by  NIfty 
50, were up by a mere 5 %. Added to the same, we 
gained market share, too. 

in 
As  always,  achievements  when  represented 
numbers,  tend  to  cloud  the  fact  that  myriad  forces 
coalesce  together  to  deliver  such  an  outcome. 
The  sustained  investments  in  our  Research  team; 
dedication  of  our  Equity  Sales  force;  best  in  class 
execution  by  our  Sales  Trading  desk  brought  this 
aspiration to see the reality of the day. 

In  exemplification,  our  Research 
coverage  now  stands  over  25O, 
adding  10%  every  year.  To  put 
things  in  perspective,  this  size 
of  the  coverage  is  enjoyed  by  a 
select  few  brokerage  houses  on 
the street. The points of pride are 
two;  one  the  sheer  breadth  of 
coverage,  and  second,  the  pace 
at which it has been put in place.

Appreciating the business from a long 
term perspective.

HDFC Securities’ Institutional business, in its current 
form, is the outcome of investments which took place 
in it at the turn of the last decade - circa 2019. The 
nature  of  the  business  is  such  that  trust,  and  quality 
of  relationships,  nurtured  over  years,  end  up  being 
the key inputs in building of the business. Easy, on the 
face  of  it,    but  onerous  in  execution.  It  is  the  nature 
of  the  business,  globally.  Painstaking  in  effort,  and 
relentlessness in focus is needed. Happy to report that 
current  upward  trajectory  of  revenue  is  an  outcome 
of  these  efforts.  To  exemplify,  on  the  ECM  front,  we 
executed seven primary market deals during the year; 
INVITs, and IPOs, across sectors.

Tellingly,  we  started  trading  with  US  clients  during 
the  Financial  Year  gone  by.  We  hosted  analyst  and 
management  roadshows  with  overseas  clients.  We 
put  in  place,  marketing  of  primary  and  secondary 
market  trades.  Once  again,  these  activities  are 
a  natural  progression  in  the  path  of  building  a 
franchise  of  repute  &  excellence.  Needless  to  say,

PROSPECTSANDOUTLOOKFORTHE
FUTURE

Economic Outlook

Growth:

India  will  remain  the  fastest-growing  economy  among 
the 
advanced  and  emerging  G-20  countries 
foreseeable  future.  The  significant  size  of  its  domestic 
market  renders  the  nation  less  vulnerable  to  potential 
shocks from global economic disruptions.

for 

India’s  GDP  growth  demonstrated  a  strong  rebound  in 
the third quarter of the financial year, reaching 6.2%, an 
improvement from the revised 5.6% (previously reported 
as  5.4%)  in  the  second  quarter  of  FY24.  Similarly,  the 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS28

growth in gross value added (GVA), which excludes tax 
and  subsidy  transfers,  measured  6.2%  year-on-year, 
increasing  from  the  revised  figure  of  5.8%  (previously 
5.6%).

The  central  bank’s  monetary  policy  adjustments, 
including  the  quarter-point  rate  cut  implemented  in 
early February and anticipated further easing measures 
in  April,  continue  to  provide  substantive  support  for 
economic  growth  momentum.  We  anticipate  growth 
will  accelerate  in  the  final  quarter  of  the  financial  year 
2024-25.  The  second  advance  estimate  for  fiscal  year 
2025 saw a slight upward revision to 6.5%, from 6.4% 
in January.

Output:

India’s  industrial  output,  as  measured  by  the  Index  of 
Industrial  Production  (IIP),  grew  by  5.0%  in  January 
from 
2025,  marking  a  significant 
December  2024’s  3.5%  and  surpassing  the  3.6% 
recorded in January 2024.

improvement 

three  major 

The 
industrial  sectors  demonstrated 
positive  performance  with  Mining  expanding  by  4.4%, 
Manufacturing by 5.5%, and Electricity by 2.4%. Within 
the manufacturing sector, 19 out of 23 industry groups 
recorded positive growth compared to January 2024.

Inflation:

India’s inflation rate currently stands at 3.62%, a seven-
month low recorded in February 2025, down from 4.31% 
in January. This represents the first time in six months that 
inflation has fallen below the Reserve Bank of India’s 4% 
mid-point target, primarily due to substantial declines in 
food and beverage prices.

Despite  the  overall  moderation,  core  inflation  has  risen 
above  the  4%  mark  for  the  first  time  in  14  months, 
reaching  4.08%.  This  increase  signals  persistent  price 
pressures in certain sectors of the economy, warranting 
continued attention from policymakers.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is expected to 
further decline to 3.9% in Q4 FY25, with an average of 
4.7% for the full fiscal year. Projections for FY26 indicate 
inflation will likely range between 4.0-4.2%, while core 
inflation may remain slightly elevated at 4.2-4.4%.

In response to these trends, the Reserve Bank of India is 
anticipated  to  implement  monetary  policy  adjustments, 
including successive rate cuts in April and August 2025, 
balancing inflation control with growth.

Fiscalhealth:

India’s direct tax collections were up 16.15 per cent year-
on-year, reaching Rs 25.86 lakh crore as of March 2025, 
as  per  the  latest  data  released  by  the  Central  Board 

of  Direct  Taxes  (CBDT).  The  corporate  tax  collections 
increased by over 7%, which indicates an increase in the 
profitability of the companies which has a positive impact 
on the economy.  The securities transaction tax has an 
impressive growth of 55.56%, which indicates increased 
trading activity in the stock market and higher investor 
participation. The combined (direct and indirect tax) Tax-
to-GDP ratio for FY 2024-25 is expected to reach 11.7%. 

India’s  Gross  GST  revenue  witnessed  a  9.9%  jump  in 
March,  reaching  over  Rs  1.96  lakh  crore,  marking  the 
second-highest  monthly  revenue  on  record.  For  the 
financial  year  2024-25,  the  total  GST  collection  stood 
at Rs 22.08 lakh crore, representing a 9.4 per cent year-
on-year  growth.  The  average  monthly  collection  for 
the Financial Year 2024-25 stood at Rs.1.84 lakh crore, 
surpassing  the  previous  year’s  average  of  Rs.1.68  lakh 
crore.

The  rise  in  tax  collections  is  a  positive  sign  for  India’s 
fiscal health, as it strengthens the government’s revenue 
base and reduces dependence on borrowing.

On  the  fiscal  front,  the  government  has  adhered  to  its 
path of fiscal consolidation with a target fiscal deficit of 
4.4%  in  2025-26.  For  the  financial  year  2024-25,  the 
centre has revised the fiscal deficit estimate to 4.8%, an 
improvement from the erstwhile estimate of 4.9% of the 
GDP.  The  centre  will  borrow  Rs  14.82  lakh  crore  from 
the markets for the financial year 2025-26 to finance its 
fiscal  deficit,  an  increase  from  expected  borrowings  of 
Rs 14.10 lakh in FY25.

Consumption:

Rural  growth  continues  to  witness  green  shoots  and 
expectations  of  a  normal  monsoon  and  taming  of 
inflation  provide  optimism  in  the  upcoming  financial 
year. 

The government’s move to extend the tax-free threshold 
to Rs 12.75 lakhs under the new tax regime, bodes well 
for  the  burgeoning  Indian  middle  class.    This  move  is 
expected  to  provide  a  boost  to  discretionary  spending 
in  the  country  in  the  coming  quarters,  providing  an 
additional impetus to economic growth.

Markets:

Corporate  earnings  growth  moderated  significantly  in 
FY  2024-25  after  years  of  double-digit  expansion,  as 
companies  faced  multiple  headwinds  including  urban 
inflation-driven 
consumption  slowdown,  persistent 
weak  demand,  reduced  public  capital  expenditure, 
rising  commodity  prices,  and  global  uncertainties.  This 
economic environment created a stark contrast in market 
performance, with the strong gains achieved in the first 
half of the fiscal year largely erased in the second half, 
though a late recovery helped the Nifty 50 close with a 
modest 5% annual gain.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com29

The  broader  market  demonstrated  slightly  better 
resilience compared to benchmark indices, with the Nifty 
Midcap  50  and  Nifty  Small-cap  50  rising  7.65%  and 
9.88% respectively, despite underperforming relative to 
previous years. 

Investors 

While  Foreign  Portfolio 
(FPIs)  remained 
significant  net  sellers  throughout  most  of  the  fiscal 
year,  Domestic  Institutional  Investors  (DIIs)  maintained 
their  position  as  consistent  buyers,  bolstered  by  robust 
Systematic  Investment  Plan  (SIP)  inflows.  In  FY25, 
Foreign  Institutional  Investors  (FIIs)  were  net  sellers 
to  the  tune  of  approximately  Rs  3.96  lakh  crore,  while 
Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) emerged as strong 
net buyers, with investments nearing Rs 6 lakh crore.

As  the  stock  markets  have  entered  a  correction  phase 
since late September, the monthly addition of new demat 
accounts also showed a declining trend, dropping from 
45.5 lakh in July 2024 to 22.6 lakh in February. However 
total demat accounts surged to 19.04 crore in February 
2025 up from 15.1 crore at the end of the previous fiscal 
year, signals a powerful democratization of the nation’s 
stock markets.  

MutualFunds:

The  total  assets  under  management  (AUM)  of  equity 
mutual  funds  surged  by  16.64%  in  the  financial  year 
2024-25, rising from Rs 23.49 lakh crore in March 2024 
to Rs 27.40 lakh crore in February 2025. The mutual fund 
industry  in  India  has  experienced  exceptional  growth, 
with inflows across all categories.  The average monthly 
inflow  into  equity  schemes  for  the  fiscal  year  stands  at 
Rs 35,632 crore, compared to Rs 15,341 crore in FY24. 
Investments through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) 
reached  new  all-time  highs,  with  Rs  26,459  crore  in 
December 2024 and Rs 25,999 crore in February 2025.

of  weakness  amid  already  slower  growth  and  sticky 
inflation, as well as trade and geopolitical tensions. The 
downgrade  was  driven  in  large  part  by  its  projection 
that growth will weaken in all three of the world’s main 
engines  of  economic  growth  the  United  States,  the 
European Union and, to a lesser extent, China.

The OECD sees annual real GDP growth in the United 
States,  the  world’s  largest  economy,  slowing  sharply 
from its strong 2.8% pace in 2024 to 2.2% in 2025.

TradeWar:

The new US administration under President Trump has 
rattled  global  stock  markets,  alarmed  corporates  and 
economists,  and  triggered  heated  rows  with  the  US’s 
largest  trading  partners  by  impose  tariffs  on  foreign 
imports.

tariff  proposals  and 

These 
implementations  have 
significantly  impacted  global  trade  dynamics.    Overall, 
the  cumulative  effect  of  these  tariffs  could  not  only 
reduce export revenues but also lead to job losses and 
slower  economic  growth  for  the  world.    The  situation 
necessitates  urgent  attention  between  the  U.S.  and  its 
trade partners to mitigate these impacts before they take 
full effect.

India’sLong-termGrowthProspects:

In 2014, India was the world’s 10th largest economy in 
terms of nominal GDP, now it has jumped to the world’s 
5th largest economy.  Per capita GDP at current prices 
stood  at  Rs  2.35  lakh  in  FY25,  with  a  decadal  CAGR 
growth of 9.1%.

IMF has projected that India’s GDP will grow at ~6.5% in 
both FY25 and FY26. All other top 10 world economies 
will  grow  at  much  lower  rates  with  China  projected  to 
see the second-highest GDP growth rate of 4.5%. India 
is  likely  to  become  the  third-largest  economy  in  the 
world in nominal GDP terms by 2028, as per the IMF.

India’s  structural  growth  story  remains  intact  as  the 
country  remains  the  fastest  growing  economy  globally, 
buoyed  by  favourable  demographic  dividend,  healthy 
corporate  balance  sheets  and  a  marked  improvement 
in the private capex cycle over the previous decade. As 
the  country  pivots  towards  the  next  phase  of  growth, 
formalization  and  financialization  are  expected  to  drive 
income  levels  and  subsequent  earnings  growth  in 
upcoming years. As the world readies itself to face the 
uncertainties  of  global  trade,  India’s  largely  favourable 
internal  macroeconomics  continues  to  put  it  at  an 
advantage on a global platform.

INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Members of HDFC Securities Limited

ReportontheAuditoftheStandaloneFinancialStatements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of HDFC Securities Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of 
Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.

In  our  opinion  and  to  the  best  of  our  information  and  according  to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  aforesaid  
standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, its profit including other comprehensive income, 
its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.  

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), 
as  specified  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Act.  Our  responsibilities  under  those  Standards  are  further  described  in 
the  ‘Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements’  section  of  our  report.  We  are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context. 

We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. We 
have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial

statements section of our report, including in relation to this matter. Accordingly, our audit included the performance 
of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matter below, 

provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial statements.

Key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

1. IT Systems and controls

The financial accounting and reporting systems 
of the Company are fundamentally reliant on IT 
systems  and  IT  controls  to  process  significant 
transaction volumes.

accounting  procedures 

Automated 
and 
IT  environment  controls,  which  include  IT 
governance, general IT controls over program 
development and changes, access to programs 
and data and IT operations, are required to be 
designed  and  to  operate  effectively  to  ensure 
accurate financial reporting.

to 

Therefore,  due 
the  pervasive  nature 
and  complexity  of  the  IT  environment,  the 
assessment of the general IT controls and the 
application controls specific to the accounting 
and preparation of the financial information is 
considered to be a key audit matter.

We  performed  the  following  procedures  assisted  by 
infrastructure  and 
specialized 
applications relevant to financial reporting:

IT  auditors  on  the 

IT 

•  Tested  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  IT 
access controls, including audit trail, over the information 
systems  that  are  relevant  to  financial  reporting  and 
relevant  interfaces,  configuration  and  other  identified 
application controls. 

•  Tested  IT  general  controls  (logical  access,  change 
management  and  aspects  of  IT  operational  controls). 
This  included  testing  that  requests  for  access  and 
changes  of  access  to  systems  were  appropriately 
reviewed, authorized. 

•  Tested the Company’s periodic review of access rights. 

•  We  also  tested  requests  of  changes  to  systems  for 

approval and authorization.

•  Tested  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of 
compensating  manual  controls  in  case  deficiencies 
were  identified  and,  where  necessary,  extended  the 
scope of our substantive audit procedures.

Other Information

The  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  the  other  information.  The  other  information  comprises  the 
information included in the Annual report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. 

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing  so,  consider  whether  such  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  financial  statements  or  our 
knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit  or  otherwise  appears  to  be  materially  misstated.  If,  based  on  the  work  we  have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com55

ResponsibilitiesofManagementfortheStandaloneFinancialStatements

The  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  the  matters  stated  in  section  134(5)  of  the  Act  with  respect 
to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, 
as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company’s  ability 
to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’sResponsibilitiesfortheAuditoftheStandaloneFinancialStatements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether  due  to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

•  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 

related disclosures made by management. 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS56

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor’s  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 

•  Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  including  the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and 
timing  of  the  audit  and  significant  audit  findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we 
identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

ANNEXURE2TOTHEINDEPENDENTAUDITOR’SREPORTOFEVEN

ReportontheInternalFinancialControlsunderClause(i)ofSub-section3ofSection
143oftheCompaniesAct,2013(“theAct”)

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of HDFC Securities 
Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the Company for the year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  these 
standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, 
as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both 
issued  by  ICAI.  Those  Standards  and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.

Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements  and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.

MeaningofInternalFinancialControlswithReferencetotheseStandaloneFinancialStatements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to

of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

InherentLimitationsofInternalFinancialControlswithReferencetoStandaloneFinancialStatements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In  our  opinion,  the  Company  has,  in  all  material  respects,  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
were  operating  effectively  as  at  March  31,  2025,  based  on  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by the ICAI.

II. 
of 
obligations 
The  obligation  arising  from  defined  benefit  plan  is 
determined  on  the  basis  of  actuarial  assumptions. 
Key  actuarial  assumptions  include  discount  rate, 
trends  in  salary  escalation,  actuarial  rates  and  life 
expectancy.  The  discount  rate  is  determined  by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds. The period to maturity 
of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable 
maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations. 
Due  to  complexities  involved  in  the  valuation  and 
its  long  term  nature,  defined  benefit  obligation  is 
sensitive  to  changes  in  these  assumptions.  Further 
details are disclosed in note 39.

III. Recognition of deferred tax assets / liabilities 
Deferred  tax  is  recorded  on  temporary  differences 
between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and 
their  carrying  amounts,  at  the  rates  that  have  been 
enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  reporting 
date.  The  ultimate  realization  of  deferred  tax  assets 
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
profits during the periods in which those temporary 
differences  become  deductible.  The  Company 
considers  the  expected  reversal  of  deferred  tax 
liabilities  and  projected  future  taxable  income  in 
making this assessment. The amount of the deferred 
tax  assets  considered  realizable,  however,  could  be 
reduced  in  the  near  term  if  estimates  of  the  future 
taxable income during the carry-forward period are 
reduced. Further details are disclosed in note 36.

of 
contingencies 
The recognition and measurement of other provisions 
are based on the assessment of the probability of an 
outflow  of  resources,  and  on  past  experience  and 
circumstances  known  at  the  reporting  date.  The 
actual  outflow  of  resources  at  a  future  date  may 
therefore,  vary  from  the  amount  included  in  other 
provisions.

The  Company  operates  in  a  regulatory  and  legal 
environment  that,  by  nature,  has  a  heightened 
element of litigation risk inherent to its operations. As 
a result, it is involved in various litigation, arbitration 
and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the 
ordinary course of the Company’s business.

V. Sharebasedpayments
Estimating fair value for share based payment requires 
determination  of  the  most  appropriate  valuation 
model.  The  estimate  also  requires  determination  of 
the  most  appropriate  inputs  to  the  valuation  model 
including the expected life of the option, volatility and 

dividend yield and making assumptions about them.

losses  on 
measured at amortized cost. At each reporting date, 
the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets 
carried  at  amortized  cost  are  credit-  impaired.  A 
financial  asset  is  ‘credit-  impaired’  when  one  or 
more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the 
estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset 
have occurred.

VII. Expectedcreditloss
When  determining  whether  the  risk  of  default  on 
a  financial  instrument  has  increased  significantly 
since  initial  recognition,  the  company  considers 
reasonable  and  supportable  information  that  is 
relevant  and  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort. 
This 
includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
information  and  analysis,  based  on  the  company’s 
historical  experience  and  credit  assessment  and 
including forward-looking information.

2.5. Measurement of fair values

The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures 
require  the  measurement  of  fair  values  for,  both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
When  measuring  the  fair  value  of  a  financial  asset 
or a financial liability, the Company uses observable 
market  data  as  far  as  possible.  Fair  values  are 
categorized  into  different  levels  in  a  fair  value 
hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows:

inputs  other

on  observable  market  data  (unobservable  inputs).

If  the  inputs  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value  hierarchy,  then  the  fair  value  measurement  is 
categorized  in  its  entirety  in  the  same  level  of  the 
fair  value  hierarchy  as  the  lowest  level  input  that  is 
significant to the entire measurement.

Commissions  and  fees  recognised  as  aforesaid 
are  exclusive  of  goods  and  service  tax,  securities 
transaction tax, stamp duties and other levies by SEBI 
and stock exchanges.

3.2 Interest Income from Margin Trading Funding

Interest is recognised in relation to the net loans and 
in relation to the Margin Trading Funding provided to 
customers.  Interest  income  is  recognised  using  the 

Dividend  income  is  recognized  when  the  right  to 
receive the payment is established, it is probable that 
the economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend 
can be measured reliably. This is generally when the 
shareholders approves the dividend.

3.4 Rental Income

Property  given  on  lease  to  earn  rental  income,  is 
classified  as  “Investment  Property”  and  income  is 
recognised as Rental Income

3.5 Fees and Commission Income

Fees  for  subscription  based  services  are  received 
periodically  via  third  party  but  are  recognised  as 
earned  on  a  pro-rata  basis  over  the  term  of  the 
contract. Commissions from distribution of financial 
products  are  recognised  upon  allotment  of  the 
securities  to  the  applicant  or  as  the  case  may  be, 
on  issue  of  the  insurance  policy  to  the  applicant 
after  deducting  claw  back  provision  as  per  the 
agreed  terms.  Commissions  and  fees  recognised 
as aforesaid are exclusive of goods and service tax, 
securities  transaction  tax,  stamp  duties  and  other 
levies by SEBI and stock exchanges. Referral fees to 
IB division of parent company is being received via 
email confirmation and recorded accordingly in the 
books of accounts. Third party fees and commission 
income is relied upon the third party confirmation.

3.6 Net gain on fair value changes

Any realised gain or loss on sale of financial assets 
(including investments) being classified as fair value 
through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) is recognised as “Net 
gain or loss on fair value changes” under “Revenue 
from  operations”  or  “Expenses”  respectively  in  the 
statement of profit and loss.

Similarly,  any  differences  between  the  fair  values 
of  financial  assets  (including  investments)  being 
classified  as  fair  value  through  profit  or 
loss 
(“FVTPL”),  held  by  the  Company  on  the  balance 
sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain / loss. 
In cases there is a net gain in the aggregate including 
realised, the same is recognised as “Net gain on fair

and if there is a net loss including realised the same 
is disclosed as “Net loss on fair value changes” under 
“Expenses” in the statement of Profit and Loss.

3.7 Sale of Services

Revenue from Sale of Services rendered to counter 
parties  are  recognised  as  and  when  the  related 
performance obligations are satisfied.

3.8 Other Income

In respect of other heads of Income it is accounted 
to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow and the revenue can be reliably measured, 
regardless of when the payment is being made.

3.9 (a) Property, plant and equipment

i. Recognition and measurement

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at 
acquisition  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation 
and  accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Cost 
comprises  purchase  price  and  expenses  directly 
attributable  to  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working 
condition for the intended use.

Items  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment  that  have 
been retired from active use and are held for disposal 
are stated at the lower of their net book value or net 
realisable  value  and  are  shown  separately  in  the 
standalone financial statements.

Gains  or  losses  arising  from  disposal  or  retirement 
of  tangible  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
are recognised net, within “Other Income” or “Other 
Expenses”,  as  the  case  maybe,  in  the  Statement  of 
Profit and Loss in the year of disposal or retirement.

Capital  work-in-progress  are  Property,  plant  and 
equipment which are not yet ready for their intended 
use. Such assets are carried at cost comprising direct 
cost and related incidental expenses.

ii. Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent  expenditure  related  to  an  item  of 
Property, plant and equipment are added to its book 
value  only  if  it  increases  the  future  benefits  from 
the  existing  asset  beyond  its  previously  assessed 
standard of performance.

iii. Depreciation

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  a  straight-line  basis 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows. 
When  significant  parts  of  plant  and  equipment  are 
required  to  be  replaced  at  intervals,  the  Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives

For the following categories of assets, Depreciation 
on Property, plant and equipment has been provided 
on  the  straight-line  method  as  per  the  useful  life 
prescribed  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 
2013.

equipment and furniture and fixtures over estimated 
useful  lives  which  are  different  from  the  useful  life 
prescribed  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 
2013. The management believes that these estimated 
useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation 
of  the  period  over  which  the  assets  are  likely  to  be 
used, as below

When  the  use  of  a  property  changes  from  owner-
occupied  to  investment  property,  the  property  is 
reclassified  as  investment  property  at  its  carrying 
amount on the date of reclassification.

3.9. (b) Intangible assets

i. Recognition and measurement

Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net 
of  accumulated  amortisation  and  accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
Cost of an intangible asset includes purchase price, 
non-refundable  taxes  and  duties  and  any  other 
directly  attributable  expenditure  on  making  the 
asset ready for its intended use and net of any trade 
discounts and rebates.

ii. Subsequent expenditure

the 

Subsequent  expenditure  on  an  intangible  asset  is 
charged  to  the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  as  an 
expense unless it is probable that such expenditure 
will  enable 
the 
future  benefits  from  the  existing  asset  beyond  its 
previously  assessed  standard  of  performance  and 
such  expenditure  can  be  measured  and  attributed 
to  the  intangible  asset  reliably,  in  which  case,  such 
expenditure is capitalised.

increase 

Expenditure  on  software  development  eligible  for 
capitalisation are carried as Intangible assets under 
development where such assets are not yet ready for 
their intended use.

iii. Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  The  amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed at 
each reporting date. If the expected useful life of the 
asset is significantly different from previous estimates, 
the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

Gains  or  losses  arising  from  the  retirement  or 
disposal of an intangible asset are determined as the 
difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and 
the carrying amount of the asset and recognised as 
income  or  expense  in  the  Statement  of  Profit  and 
Loss in the year of disposal.

The  estimated  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  used 
for amortisation are:

acquisition.

3.10. Investment property

Property  given  on  lease  to  earn  rental  income,  is 
classified as “Investment Property” as per requirement 
of  Ind  AS  40  “Investment  Property”.  Upon  initial 
recognition,  an  investment  property  is  measured  at 
cost.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  investment 
property  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any.

Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis to fully 
depreciate the assets using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

For the following categories of assets, Depreciation

straight-line method as per the useful life prescribed 

in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.

3.11. Impairment of non-financial assets 

Assessment  is  done  at  each  reporting  date  as  to 
whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible 
and intangible) may be impaired. For the purpose of 
assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group 
of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets, is considered 
as a cash generating unit. If any such indication exists, 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com77

an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset/
cash generating unit is made. Assets whose carrying 
value  exceeds  their  recoverable  amount  are  written 
down  to  the  recoverable  amount.  Recoverable 
amount  is  higher  of  an  asset’s  or  cash  generating 
unit’s net selling price and its value in use. Value in 
use  is  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash 
flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an 
asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. 
Assessment is also done at each reporting date as to 
whether  there  is  any  indication  that  an  impairment 
loss  recognised  for  an  asset  in  prior  accounting 
periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

After impairment (if any), depreciation/ amortisation 
is  provided  on  the  revised  carrying  amount  of  the 
assets over its remaining life.

3.12. Financial Instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or  equity  instrument  of  another  entity.  Financial 
instruments also include derivative contracts such as 
foreign currency forward contracts.

instruments  also  covers  contracts 

to 
Financial 
buy  or  sell  a  non-financial  item  that  can  be  settled 
net  in  cash  or  another  financial  instrument,  or  by 
exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts 
were  financial  instruments,  with  the  exception  of 
contracts that were entered into and continue to be 
held  for  the  purpose  of  the  receipt  or  delivery  of  a 
non-financial  item  in  accordance  with  the  entity’s 
expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.

I. Recognition and initial measurement

Trade  receivables,  Loans  and  deposits  are  initially 
recognised  when  they  are  originated.  All  other 
financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised 
when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  is  initially 
measured  at  fair  value  plus,  for  an  item  not  at  fair 
value  through  profit  and  loss  (‘FVTPL’),  transaction 
costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  its  acquisition 
or issued.

II. Classification and subsequent measurement

Financialassets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as 
measured at :

-    Amortised cost;

-    Fair value through profit and loss (‘FVTPL’);

-   Fair value through other comprehensive income 

(‘FVOCI’)”

Financialassets(otherthanequityinstruments)
Financial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets. The Company classifies its financial 
assets in the following measurement categories:

Financial assets measured at amortized cost 
A  financial  asset  that  meets  the  following  two 
conditions  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  (net  of 
any written down for impairment) unless the asset is 
designated at FVTPL under the fair value option.

Business model test:  The  objective  of 
the 
Company’s  business  model  is  to  hold  the  financial 
asset  to  collect  the  contractual  cash  flows  (rather 
than  to  sell  the  instrument  prior  to  its  contractual 
maturity to realize its fair value changes).

Cash flow characteristics test:  The  contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financialassets(equityinstruments)
Financial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets. The Company classifies its financial 
assets  in  the  following  measurement  categories: 

All equity instruments are to be measured at
FVTPL.
On initial recognition, a one time irrevocable choice 
for all equity instruments to designate the respective 
equity  instrument  as  Fair  Value  through  Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). All unrealized gains 
and  losses  are  recognised  in  OCI  and  on  disposal 
such  accumulated  gains  or  losses  are  transferred 
directly to retained earnings.

Financial assets measured at Fair Value

A financial asset which is not classified at amortized 
cost is subsequently meaured at fair valued. Where 
assets  are  measured  at  fair  value,  gains  and  losses 
are  either  recognized  entirely  in  the  statement  of 
profit and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss), or 
recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income).

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
78

The  assets  classified 
the  aforementioned 
categories  are  subsequently  measured  as  follows: 

in 

a) Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
(FVTPL): These assets are subsequently measured at 
fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest 
or dividend income, are recognized in the statement 
of  profit  and  loss.  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for 
trading  and  whose  performance  is  evaluated  on  a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

b)  Financial  assets  at  Fair  Value  Through  Other 
Comprehensive  Income  (FVOCI):  These  assets  are 
subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income 
under  the  effective 
interest  method,  dividends 
(unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of 
part of the cost of the investment), foreign exchange 
gains  and  losses  and  impairment  are  recognised 
in  profit  or  loss.  Other  net  gains  and  losses  are 
recognised  in  OCI.  On  derecognition,  gains  and 
losses  accumulated  in  OCI  are  reclassified  to  profit 
or loss.

Financial Liabilities

Classification,  subsequent  measurement  and 
gains and losses 

Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at 
amortised  cost  or  FVTPL.  A  financial  liability  is 
classified  as  at  FVTPL  if  it  is  classified  as  held- 
for-  trading,  or  it  is  a  derivative  or  it  is  designated 
as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities 
at  FVTPL  are  measured  at  fair  value  and  net  gains 
and  losses,  including  any  interest  expense,  are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the  effective  interest  method.  Interest  expense  and 
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in 
profit  or  loss.  Any  gain  or  loss  on  derecognition  is 
also recognised in profit or loss.

III. Derecognition

FinancialAssets

The  Company  derecognises  a  financial  asset  when 
the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the 
financial  asset  expire,  or  it  transfers  the  rights  to 
receive  the  contractual  cash  flows  in  a  transaction 
in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership  of  the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or 
in  which  the  Company  neither  transfers  nor  retains 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
and does not retain control of the financial asset.

The  Company  enters  into  transactions  whereby  it 
transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but 
retains  either  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and 
rewards  of  the  transferred  assets,  the  transferred 
assets are not derecognised.

Financialliabilities

The  Company  derecognises  a  financial  liability 
when  its  contractual  obligations  are  discharged  or 
cancelled, or expire.

IV. Offsetting

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset 
and the net amount presented in the balance sheet 
when, and only when, the Company currently has a 
legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and 
it  intends  either  to  settle  them  on  a  net  basis  or  to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

V. Impairment

Overview of the ECL principles
The  Company  recognises 
expected credit losses on:

loss  allowances 

for 

-  financial assets measured at amortised cost; and
-  financial  assets  measured  at  FVOCI-  debt 

investments.

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses 
whether  financial  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost 
and  debt  securities  at  FVOCI  are  credit-  impaired. 
A  financial  asset  is  ‘credit-  impaired’  when  one  or 
more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the 
estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset 
have occurred.

The  Company  considers  that  the  credit  risk  on  a 
financial asset has increased significantly if it is more 
than 90 days past due

3.13. Employee benefits

i) Short term employee benefits

Short  term  employee  benefits  include  salaries  and 
short term cash bonus. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash 
bonus  or  target  based  incentives  if  the  Company 
has a present legal or constrictive obligation to pay 
this  amount  as  a  result  of  past  service  provided  by 
the  employee,  and  the  obligation  can  be  estimated 
reliably. These costs are recognised as an expense in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss at the undiscounted 
amount  expected  to  be  paid  over  the  period  of 
services rendered by the employees to the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com

ii) Defined-contribution plans

These  are  plans  in  which  the  Company  pays  pre-
defined  amounts  to  separate  funds  and  does  not 
have  any  legal  or  constrictive  obligation  to  pay 
additional sums. These comprise of contributions to 
the National pension scheme, employees’ provident 
fund  and  family  pension  fund.  The  Company’s 
payments  to  the  defined-contribution  plans  are 
reported as expenses during the period in which the 
employees  perform  the  services  that  the  payment 
covers.

iii) Defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plan is a post-employee benefit 
plan other than a defined contribution plan. Expenses 
for  defined-benefit  plan  in  the  nature  of  gratuity 
are  calculated  annualy  by  an  independent  actuary 
using  Projected  Unit  Credit  Method  (PUCM).  These 
commitments are valued at the present value of the 
expected  future  payments,  with  consideration  for 
calculated  future  salary  increases,  using  a  discount 
rate  corresponding  to  the  interest  rate  estimated 
by  the  actuary  having  regard  to  the  interest  rate 
on  government  bonds.  The  fair  values  of  the  plan 
assets  are  deducted  in  determining  the  net  liability. 
When  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets  exceeds  the 
commitments computed as aforesaid, the recognised 
asset is limited to the net total of any cumulative past 
service costs and the present value of any economic 
benefits available in the form of reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, 
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect 
of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any,  excluding  interest),  are 
recognised in OCI.

iv) Other long term employee benefits

Compensated absences which accrue to employees 
and which can be carried to future periods and are 
expected to be availed in more than twelve months 
immediately following the year in which the employee 
has  rendered  service  are  reported  as  expenses 
during the year in which the employees perform the 
services that the benefit covers and the liabilities are 
reported at the undiscounted amount of the benefits.

v) Share-based payment transactions

Equity-settled  share-based  payments  to  employees 
that  are  granted  are  measured  by  reference  to  the 
fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant  date  of  the 
equity-settled sharebased payments is expensed on 

a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the  Company’s  estimate  of  equity  instruments  that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in 
equity. At the end of each period, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest based on the vesting conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.

vi)Otherexpenses

All other expenses are recognized in the period they 
accrue/occur.

3.14. Current and deferred tax

Tax  expense  for  the  period,  comprising  current  tax 
and deferred tax, are included in the determination 
of the net profit or loss for the period.

Current tax is measured at the amount of tax payable 
on  the  taxable  income  for  the  year  determined  in 
accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 
1961. The amount of current tax payable or receivable 
is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be 
paid  or  received  that  reflects  uncertainty  related  to 
income taxes, if any.

Deferred  tax  is  recognised  for  all  the  temporary 
differences,  being  the  differences  between  the 
taxable  income  and  the  accounting  income  that 
originate in one period and are capable of reversal in 
one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by  the  Balance  Sheet  date  and  reflects  uncertainty 
related to income taxes, if there is any. Deferred tax 
assets  are  recognised  and  carried  forward  only  to 
the extent it is probable that sufficient future taxable 
income will be available against which such deferred 
tax  assets  can  be  realised.  The  carrying  amount  of 
deferred  tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting 
date  and  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
to  allow  all  or  part  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  be 
utilised.  Unrecognised  deferred  tax  assets  are  re-
assessed at each reporting date and are recognised 
to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off 
the  recognised  amounts  and  there  is  an  intention 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS80

to  settle  the  asset  and  the  liability  on  a  net  basis. 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set 
off  assets  against  liabilities  representing  current  tax 
and where the deferred tax assets and the deferred 
tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the 
same governing taxation laws.

3.15. Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions: Provisions are recognised when there is 
a present obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the 
obligation  and  there  is  a  reliable  estimate  of  the 
amount  of  the  obligation.  Provisions  are  measured 
at  the  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure  required  to 
settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  Balance  sheet 
date and are not discounted to its present value.

Contingent Liabilities: Contingent 
liabilities 
are  disclosed  when  there  is  a  possible  obligation 
arising  from  past  events,  the  existence  of  which 
will  be  confirmed  only  by  the  occurrence  or  non-
occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain  future  events 
not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company  or  a 
present obligation that arises from past events where 
it is either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made, is termed as a contingent 
liability.

Bank Guarantee:  Bank  Guarantee  are  been  taken 
from banks and kept with exchanges as a margin to 
meet the margin obligation.

3.16. Cash and cash equivalents

In  the  Cash  Flow  Statement,  cash  and  cash 
equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits 
and  short  term  deposit  with  banks  with  original 
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  and  other  short-
term  highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which 
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

3.17. Leases

The Company as lessee

The Company lease as set classes primarily consist 
of leases for office premises. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 

a  contract.  A  contract  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  if  the 
contract  conveys  the  right  to  control  the  use  of  an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:

(i)  the  contract  involves  the  use  of  an  identified 

asset

(ii)  the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease and

(iii)  the Company has the right to direct the use of the 

asset.

At  the  date  of  commencement  of  the  lease,  the 
Company  recognizes  a  right-of-use  asset  (“ROU”) 
and  a  corresponding  lease  liability  for  all  lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee.

Certain  lease  arrangements  includes  the  options  to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.

The  right-of-use  assets  are  initially  recognized  at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior  to  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease  plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use  assets  are  depreciated 
the 
commencement  date  on  a  straight-line  basis  over 
the  shorter  of  the  lease  term  and  useful  life  of  the 
underlying asset.

from 

The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country 
of  domicile  of  these  leases.  Lease  liabilities  are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.

Lease  liability  and  ROU  asset  have  been  separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com81

3.18. Foreign currency

Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated 
into the functional currency of the Company at the 
exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions  or 
an average rate if the average rate approximates the 
actual rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial 
recognition  in  the  functional  currency,  using  the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items 
are reported using the closing exchange rate.

Exchange  differences  that  arise  on  settlement  of 
monetary items or on reporting at each closing date 
of  the  Company’s  monetary  items  at  the  closing 
rate are recognized as income and expenses in the 
period in which they arise. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency shall be translated into functional 
currency using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Exchange differences 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

3.19. Earning per Share

The  basic  earnings  per  share  (‘EPS’)  is  computed 
by  dividing  the  net  profit  /  (loss)  after  tax  for  the 
year  attributable  to  the  equity  shareholders  by 
the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares 
outstanding during the year.

For  the  purpose  of  calculating  diluted  earnings  per 
share, net profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable 
to the equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year 
are  adjusted  for  the  effects  of  all  dilutive  potential 
equity shares.

3.20. Segment Reporting

The  Company’s  business  is  to  provide  broking 
services, to its clients, in the capital markets in India. 
All  other  activities  of  the  Company  are  ancillary  to 
the main business. As such, there are no reportable 
segments  that  need  to  be  reported  separately  as 
defined in Ind AS 108, Operating Segments.

3.21. Borrowing Costs

The  difference  between  the  discounted  amount 
mobilized  and  redemption  value  of  commercial 
papers  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of  profit  and 
loss over the life of the instrument with reference to 
effective interest rate method.

3.22. Dividend Policy

The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend 
to equity holders of the parent when the distribution 
is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company.

The fair value measurement for the property to be valued is commerical which is the highest and best use, been categorised as a 
level 2 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs include comparable sale instances for Market Ap-
proach. 

Valuation technique

For the purpose of valuation, the primary valuation methodology used is Market Approach, as the best evidence of fair value is 
current prices in an active market for similar properties. The market rate for sale/purchase of similar assets is representative of fair 
values. The property to be valued is at a location where active market is available for similar kind of properties.

substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right 
to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease 
liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term 
leases) and low value leases (underlying asset of less than `1,50,000). For these short-term and low value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company 
has recognised `NIL towards short-term lease and `NIL towards low value assets during the year ended 31 March 2025. The 
Company has recognised `1,132 lacs (previous year –`1,088 lacs) towards the leases pertaining to the locations which are not 
separately identifiable units.

Certain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
prepaid lease plus any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of the Company. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding 
adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments of `1,325 lacs (previous 
year – `1,305 lacs) have been classified as financing cash flows. 

Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The 
Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term. 
The Company has recognised `NIL towards income from sub-lease.

Note 42: Segment Reporting

The Company’s business is to provide brokerage services to its clients in the capital markets within India. All other activities of the 
Company revolve around the main business. As such, there are no separate reportable segments as per the Ind AS on Operating 
Segment (Ind AS 108), specified under the Companies Act, 2013. The necessary information to report the revenues from the 
external customers for each product and service, or each group of similar products and service is not available and the cost 
to develop it would be excessive. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews the operations of the Company as one 
operating segment. Hence no separate segment information has been furnished herewith. Similarly, the geographical information 
related to the revenue from the external customers attributed to the entity’s country of domicile and to all other foreign countries 
in total is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive. No single customer accounts for the revenue, which is equal 
or more than ten percent of the total revenue of the entity, hence no such segment could be identified.

2. Fair Value hierarchy

The following is the hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs). 

3. Valuation techniques used to determine fair value

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments includes investment in equity investment valued at 
quoted closing price on stock exchange / other basis based on materiality. 

Transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3
There were no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3.

4. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
Financial assets not measured at fair value includes cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and other 
financial assets. These are financial assets whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, due to their short-term 
nature.

Additionally, financial liabilities such as trade payables and other financial liabilities are not measured at FVTPL, 
whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, because of their short-term nature. 

B. Financial risk management

Company has operations in India. Whilst risk is inherent in the Company’s activities, it is managed through an 
integrated risk management framework, including ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to 
risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Company’s continuing profitability 
and each individual within the Company is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. 
The Company is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to various operating and 
business risks. 

a. Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incurr a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge 
their contractual obligation. The Company manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it 
is willing to accept for individual counterparties, and by monitoring exposures in relations to such limits.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial instruments is the carrying amount of that class of 
financial instruments presented in the financial statements. The Company’s major classes of financial assets are 
cash and cash equivalents, loans, investment in mutual fund units & Government Securities, term deposits, trade 
receivables and security deposits.

Expected Credit Loss (ECL):  
For the purpose of computation of ECL, the term default implies an event where amount due towards margin 
requirement and / or mark to market losses for which the client was unable to provide funds / collaterals to bridge 
the shortfall, the same is termed as margin call triggered.

For arriving at the ECL, the Company follows ECL model as approved by board. 

3. Staging Definition:- 
For the purpose of the computation of Expected credit losses, three stages have been defined as below:- 
Stage 1:- Client having open positions in MTF (Margin Trading Funding).  
Stage 2:- The dues /debits, post position square off, which are outstanding for more than 2 days but less than 30 
days. 
Stage 3:- The dues /debits, post position square off, which are outstanding for more than 30 days. 

Computation of Expected Credit Losses for MTF:- 
As per Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 109 on Financial Instruments, an entity shall recognise a loss allowance 
for expected credit losses on a financial asset and shall measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument. 

Based on the above, expected credit loss has been computed taking into consideration the probability of the 
borrower default (PD), expected exposure at the time when the borrower defaults (EAD), the expected loss as a 
percentage of the EAD, conditional on the borrower defaulting LGD (Loss given default).

Expected Credit loss model has been used to recognize the provision (or credit losses) based on expected losses 
at client level having open position in MTF as on reporting date. The expected loss at client level is calculated as 
follows:  
EL = PD × LGD × EAD  
The final aggregate amount is computed to arrive at Final Expected Credit Loss (ECL) across HSL.

The fundamental of the above parameters used are as follows:- 
PD: the probability of the borrower default 
EAD: expected exposure at the time when the borrower defaults (Exposure at default) 
LGD: the expected loss as a percentage of the EAD, conditional on the borrower defaulting (Loss given default) 
EL: Expected loss

ECL for Trade Receivables (broking clients) :- 
For Trade Receivables (Equity and Derivative Products), current policy of providing 100% for all outstanding debits 
where the dues are not recoverable (uncovered position after square off), or, is outstanding for more than 90 days 
is being followed.

ECL for Trade Receivable (Third Party Products Receivables):- 
For Trade receivables of Third Party Products, any amount which is not received within 90 days is 100% provided 
for, except for the receivables which pertain to any HDFC group company, or to any Exchange to regulator related 
receivables. 

ECL on ESOP Funding: 
All the clients to whom ESOP funding is offered are the trading clients only. Similar treatment of MTF as described 
above, will be given to the outstanding amount on ESOP funding clients also.

b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The entity’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as 
possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the entity’s reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management requires sufficient cash and marketable securities and availability of funds through adequate 
committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions.

The Company has a view of maintaining liquidity with minimal risks while making investments. The Company invests its surplus 
funds in short term liquid assets in bank deposits and liquid mutual funds. The Company monitors its cash and bank balances 
periodically in view of its short term obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future Cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, 
while optimizing the return.

i.Foreigncurrencyrisk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company does not have any foreign currency exposure as at each reporting date. 
Accordingly, foreign currency risk disclosure is not applicable. 

ii.Interestraterisk 
The Company is exposed to Interest risk if the fair value or future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate as a result 
of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing 
investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. 

The Company’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings, interest bearing deposits with bank and loans given to customers. Such 
instruments expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. Management believe that the interest rate risk attached to this 
financial assets are not significant due to the nature of this financial assets. All the borrowings of the company are fixed interest 
rate bearing instruments and hence there is no impact of movement in interest rate. 

iii.Marketpricerisks 
The Company is exposed to market price risk, which arises from FVTPL investment in mutual funds. The management monitors 
the proportion of mutual fund investments in its investment portfolio based on market indices. Material investments within the 
portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the appropriate authority.

i.  SUN System ERP (Accounting Software): 

Since inception, the audit trail functionality has been activated to critical financial tables ensuring transparency 
and accountability in our financial record-keeping Systems. The snapshot of the enabled tables have been 
furnished during audit. 
Audit logs have consistently been generated, providing a comprehensive trail of financial transactions and 
activities. 
The activation of audit functionality has been integral to our internal control framework, facilitating compliance 
with regulatory requirements and enhancing stakeholder confidence. 

The Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account which has a feature of 
recording audit trail (edit log) facility, the audit log was enabled and operated throughout the year for relevant 
transactions recorded in SUN accounting software. 

Precision (Trading backend system): 
Immutability of Submitted Entries:- 
Once an entry is submitted, it cannot be modified, and there is no front-end screen available for modifications, 
ensuring the integrity and reliability of entered data. 

Limited Access to DBA Changes:- Access to Database Administrator (DBA) changes is restricted to a select 
group of individuals, following the four-eye principle with multiple reviews to prevent inadvertent command 
execution. 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
124

Data Model Security:- The data model and know-how are exclusively maintained by TCS (Tata Consultancy 
Services), ensuring that only authorized patches provided by TCS are applied, thus mitigating the risk of 
unauthorized data tampering. 

Functional Role Assignment: 
Functional roles are assigned to application users in the back-office application, grouping various screens. 
Access to screens are granted based on these assigned roles.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-Access to screens is contingent upon the assignment of roles, which are 
maintained within the database. Additionally, the system logs the date and time stamp of any modifications to 
these role assignments.

Transaction Logging:- All financial transactions are recorded in the financial ledger with an insert-only option; 
there is no provision for updates or deletes. Once data is entered into the table, it becomes permanent and 
immutable. The system automatically captures metadata such as “created by,” “create date,” and “program ID,” 
facilitating traceability and accountability.

The robust controls and mitigation measures implemented within the Precision system provide a strong 
foundation for preventing data tampering and ensuring the integrity of financial transactions. These measures, 
including the immutability of submitted entries, restricted access to DBA changes, and thorough transaction 
logging, contribute to a secure and reliable data environment. We are confident that these controls effectively 
mitigate the risks associated with data tampering and support the integrity of our financial reporting processes.

The Company has used accounting softwares SUN and Precision for maintaining its books of account which 
has a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all 
relevant transactions recorded in the software. Audit log enabled within the production database of SUN and 
Precision on August 16, 2024 and March 21, 2025 respectively to record or track the database management 
layer (“DML”) statements (insert, update, delete) executed by the database administrator. However, management 
is not in possession of complete data to determine whether audit trail feature of the said software was enabled 
and operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded in the software or whether there were 
any instances of the audit trail feature being tampered with, in respect of an accounting software(s) where the 
audit trail has been enabled. Additionally, the audit trail in respect of the financial years 2024-2025 and 2023-
2024 has been preserved by the company to the extent possible as per the statutory requirements for record 
retention

j. 

 The Company has complied with the requirements of the number of layers prescribed under Section 2(87) of 
the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Restriction on number of Layers) Rules, 2017.

k.  Quarterly statements of current assets filed with banks and financial institutions for fund borrowed from those 
banks and financial institutions on the basis of security of current assets are in agreement with the books of 
account.

INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Members of HDFC Securities Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  HDFC  Securities  Limited  (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Holding Company”), its subsidiary (the Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to 
as “the Group”) comprising of the consolidated Balance sheet as at March 31 2025, the consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including 
a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  other  explanatory  information  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the 
consolidated financial statements”).

In  our  opinion  and  to  the  best  of  our  information  and  according  to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  aforesaid 
consolidated  financial  statements  give  the  information  required  by  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  as  amended  (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025, their consolidated profit 
including other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date. 

Basis for Opinion

We  conducted  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  on  Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For the matter below, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context. 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS127

We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. We 
have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to this matter. Accordingly, our audit included the performance 
of  procedures  designed  to  respond  to  our  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated 
financial  statements.  The  results  of  audit  procedures  performed  by  us  and  by  other  auditors  of  components  not 
audited by us, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 

opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

1. IT Systems and controls

The financial accounting and reporting systems 
of  the  Holding  Company  are  fundamentally 
reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process 
significant transaction volumes.

accounting  procedures 

Automated 
and 
IT  environment  controls,  which  include  IT 
governance, general IT controls over program 
development and changes, access to programs 
and data and IT operations, are required to be 
designed  and  to  operate  effectively  to  ensure 
accurate financial reporting.

to 

the  pervasive  nature 
Therefore,  due 
and  complexity  of  the  IT  environment,  the 
assessment of the general IT controls and the 
application controls specific to the accounting 
and preparation of the financial information is 
considered to be a key audit matter.

We  performed  the  following  procedures  assisted  by 
specialized 
infrastructure  and 
applications relevant to financial reporting:

IT  auditors  on  the 

IT 

•  Tested  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  IT 
access controls, including audit trail, over the information 
systems  that  are  important  to  financial  reporting  and 
various  interfaces,  configuration  and  other  identified 
application controls. 

•  Tested  IT  general  controls  (logical  access,  change 
management  and  aspects  of  IT  operational  controls). 
This included testing that requests for access to systems 
were appropriately reviewed and authorized. 

•  Tested  the  Holding  Company’s  periodic  review  of 
access  rights.  We  also  inspected  requests  of  changes 
to systems for appropriate approval and authorization.

• 

In  addition  to  the  above,  we  tested  the  design  and 
operating  effectiveness  of  certain  automated  and  IT 
dependent manual controls that were considered as key 
internal controls over financial reporting.

•  Tested 

the  design  and  operating  effectiveness 
in  case  deficiencies  were 
compensating  controls 
identified and, where necessary, extended the scope of 
our substantive audit procedures.

Other Information

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. 

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com128

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and 
consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and 
detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making 
judgments  and  estimates  that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of 
adequate  internal  financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness 
of  the  accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those  charged  with  governance  of  the  companies  included  in  the  Group  are  also  responsible  for  overseeing  the 
financial reporting process of their respective companies.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

•  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion  on  whether  the  Holding  Company  has  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS129

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 

related disclosures made by management. 

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor’s  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor’s  report.  However,  future  events  or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 

•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group of which we are the independent auditors, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements.  We  are  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  financial 
statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Matter

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include unaudited financial statements and other unaudited 
financial information in respect of one subsidiary, whose financial statements and other financial information reflect 
total assets of Rs 29,40,340 as at March 31, 2025, and total revenues of Rs. Nil, total comprehensive loss of Rs. 
56,52,570 and net cash outflows/(inflows) of Rs. Nil for the period October 01, 2024 to March 31, 2025 respectively. 
These unaudited financial statements and other unaudited financial information have been furnished to us by the 
management. Our opinion, in so far as it relates amounts and disclosures included in respect of the subsidiary, and 
our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary, is 
based solely on such unaudited financial statements and other unaudited financial information. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, these financial statements and other 
financial information are not material to the Group.

ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN 
DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HDFC 
SECURITIES LIMITED

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of HDFC Securities Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary (the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary together referred to as “the Group”), which are companies incorporated in India, as of 
that date. 

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over 
financial  reporting  criteria  established  by  the  Holding  Company  considering  the  essential  components  of  internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI).  These  responsibilities  include  the  design,  implementation  and 
maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both,  issued  by  ICAI.  Those  Standards  and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.

Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com134

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In  our  opinion,  the  Group,  which  are  companies  incorporated  in  India,  have,  maintained  in  all  material  respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

2.2. Functional and presentation currency

statements  are 
These  Consolidated  financial 
presented  in  Indian  Rupees  (INR),  which  is  also 
the  Company’s  functional  currency.  All  amounts 
have  been  rounded-off  to  the  nearest  lacs,  unless 
otherwise indicated.

assets,  they  are  estimated  by  management  based 
on  technical  advice,  taking  into  account  the  nature 
of  the  asset,  the  estimated  usage  of  the  asset,  the 
operating  conditions  of  the  asset,  past  history  of 
replacement,  anticipated  technological  changes, 
manufacturers’ warranties and maintenance support.

2.3. Basis of measurement

The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been 
prepared on the historical cost basis except for the 
following items:

assets and

present value of defined 
benefit obligations 

Fair value (refer accounting 
policies regarding financial 
instruments)

2.4. Use of estimates & Judgements

The  preparation  of 
the  Consolidated  financial 
statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires 
management  to  make  estimates,  judgments  and 
assumptions.  These  estimates, 
judgments  and 
assumptions  affect  the  application  of  accounting 
policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities,  the  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and 
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  Consolidated  financial 
statements  and  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and 
expenses  during  the  period.  Accounting  estimates 
could  change  from  period  to  period.  Actual  results 
could  differ  from  those  estimates.  Appropriate 
changes  in  estimates  are  made  as  management 
becomes  aware  of  changes 
in  circumstances 
surrounding the estimates. Estimates and underlying 
assumptions  are  reviewed  ongoing  basis.  Changes 
in  estimates  are  reflected  in  the  stanalone  financial 
statements in the period in which changes are made 
and,  if  material,  their  effects  are  disclosed  in  the 
notes to the Consolidated financial statements.

of 
obligations 
The  obligation  arising  from  defined  benefit  plan  is 
determined  on  the  basis  of  actuarial  assumptions. 
Key  actuarial  assumptions  include  discount  rate, 
trends  in  salary  escalation,  actuarial  rates  and  life 
expectancy.  The  discount  rate  is  determined  by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds. The period to maturity 
of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable 
maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations. 
Due  to  complexities  involved  in  the  valuation  and 
its  long  term  nature,  defined  benefit  obligation  is 
sensitive  to  changes  in  these  assumptions.  Further 
details are disclosed in note 39.

III. Recognition of deferred tax assets / liabilities 
Deferred  tax  is  recorded  on  temporary  differences 
between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and 
their  carrying  amounts,  at  the  rates  that  have  been 
enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  reporting 
date.  The  ultimate  realization  of  deferred  tax  assets 
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
profits during the periods in which those temporary 
differences  become  deductible.  The  Company 
considers  the  expected  reversal  of  deferred  tax 
liabilities  and  projected  future  taxable  income  in 
making this assessment. The amount of the deferred 
tax  assets  considered  realizable,  however,  could  be 
reduced  in  the  near  term  if  estimates  of  the  future 
taxable income during the carry-forward period are 
reduced. Further details are disclosed in note 36.

IV. 
of 
contingencies 
The recognition and measurement of other provisions 
are based on the assessment of the probability of an 
outflow  of  resources,  and  on  past  experience  and 
circumstances  known  at  the  reporting  date.  The 
actual  outflow  of  resources  at  a  future  date  may 
therefore,  vary  from  the  amount  included  in  other 
provisions.

The  Company  operates  in  a  regulatory  and  legal 
environment  that,  by  nature,  has  a  heightened 
element of litigation risk inherent to its operations. As 
a result, it is involved in various litigation, arbitration 
and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the 
ordinary course of the Company’s business.

Share based payments

V. 
Estimating fair value for share based payment requires 
determination  of  the  most  appropriate  valuation 
model.  The  estimate  also  requires  determination  of 
the  most  appropriate  inputs  to  the  valuation  model 
including the expected life of the option, volatility and 
dividend yield and making assumptions about them. 
The assumption and models used for estimating fair 
value  for  share  based  payments  transactions  are 
disclosed  in  Note  44  Employee  stock  option  plan 
(ESOP).

If  the  inputs  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value  hierarchy,  then  the  fair  value  measurement  is 
categorized  in  its  entirety  in  the  same  level  of  the 
fair  value  hierarchy  as  the  lowest  level  input  that  is 
significant to the entire measurement.

The Company recognizes transfers between levels of 
the  fair  value  hierarchy  at  the  end  of  the  reporting 
period during which the change has occurred.

Impairment

The  Company  recognizes

its  financial  assets 
losses  on 
measured at amortized cost. At each reporting date, 
the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets 
carried  at  amortized  cost  are  credit-  impaired.  A 
financial  asset  is  ‘credit-  impaired’  when  one  or 
more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the 
estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset 
have occurred.

VII.  Expected credit loss
When  determining  whether  the  risk  of  default  on 
a  financial  instrument  has  increased  significantly 
since  initial  recognition,  the  company  considers 
reasonable  and  supportable  information  that  is 
relevant  and  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort. 
This 
includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
information  and  analysis,  based  on  the  company’s 
historical  experience  and  credit  assessment  and 
including forward-looking information.

2.5. Measurement of fair values

The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures 
require  the  measurement  of  fair  values  for,  both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
When  measuring  the  fair  value  of  a  financial  asset 
or a financial liability, the Company uses observable 
market  data  as  far  as  possible.  Fair  values  are 
categorized  into  different  levels  in  a  fair  value 
hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows:

inputs  other

3.1. Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Revenue  (other  than  for  those  items  to  which  Ind 
AS  109  Financial  Instruments  are  applicable)  is 
measured  at  transaction  price.  Ind  AS  115,  Revenue 
from  contracts  with  customers,  outlines  a  single 
comprehensive  model  of  accounting  for  revenue 
arising from contracts with customers.

The  Company  recognises  revenue  from  contracts 
with customers based on a five step model as set out 
in Ind AS 115:

Step  1:  Identify  contract(s)  with  a  customer:  A 
contract  is  defined  as  an  agreement  between  two 
or  more  parties  that  creates  enforceable  rights  and 
obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract 
that must be met.

Step  2:  Identify  performance  obligations  in  the 
contract:  A  performance  obligation  is  a  promise  in 
a  contract  with  a  customer  to  transfer  a  good  or 
service to the customer.

Step  3:  Determine  the  transaction  price:  The 
transaction  price  is  the  amount  of  consideration 
to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled 
in  exchange  for  transferring  promised  goods  or 
services to a customer, excluding amounts collected 
on behalf of third parties. 

Step  4:  Allocate  the  transaction  price  to  the 
performance  obligations  in  the  contract:  For  a 
contract  that  has  more  than  one  performance 
obligation,  the  Company  allocates  the  transaction 
price to each performance obligation in an amount 
that  depicts  the  amount  of  consideration  to  which 
the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for 
satisfying each performance obligation.

Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company 
satisfies a performance obligation

rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
receipts through expected life of the related financial 
asset to the gross carrying amount of such financial 
asset.

3.3 Dividend Income

Dividend  income  is  recognized  when  the  right  to 
receive the payment is established, it is probable that 
the economic benefits associated with the dividend 
will flow to the entity and the amount of the dividend

periodically  via  third  party  but  are  recognised  as 
earned  on  a  pro-rata  basis  over  the  term  of  the 
contract. Commissions from distribution of financial 
products  are  recognised  upon  allotment  of  the 
securities  to  the  applicant  or  as  the  case  may  be, 
on  issue  of  the  insurance  policy  to  the  applicant 
after  deducting  claw  back  provision  as  per  the 
agreed  terms.  Commissions  and  fees  recognised 
as aforesaid are exclusive of goods and service tax, 
securities  transaction  tax,  stamp  duties  and  other 
levies by SEBI and stock exchanges. Referral fees to 
IB division of parent company is being received via 
email confirmation and recorded accordingly in the 
books of accounts. Third party fees and commission 
income is relied upon the third party confirmation.

3.6 Net gain on fair value changes

Any realised gain or loss on sale of financial assets 
(including investments) being classified as fair value 
through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) is recognised as “Net 
gain or loss on fair value changes” under “Revenue 
from  operations”  or  “Expenses”  respectively  in  the 
Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.

Similarly,  any  differences  between  the  fair  values 
of  financial  assets  (including  investments)  being 
classified  as  fair  value  through  profit  or 
loss 
(“FVTPL”),  held  by  the  Company  on  the  balance 
sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain / loss. 
In cases there is a net gain in the aggregate including 
realised, the same is recognised as “Net gain on fair 
value  changes”  under  “Revenue  from  operations” 
and if there is a net loss including realised the same 
is  disclosed  as  “Net  loss  on  fair  value  changes” 
under “Expenses” in the consolidated Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss.

3.7 Sale of Services

Revenue from Sale of Services rendered to counter 
parties  are  recognised  as  and  when  the  related 
performance obligations are satisfied.

3.8 Other Income

to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow and the revenue can be reliably measured, 
regardless of when the payment is being made.

3.9 (a) Property, plant and equipment

i. Recognition and measurement

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at 
acquisition  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation 
and  accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Cost 
comprises  purchase  price  and  expenses  directly 
attributable  to  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working 
condition for the intended use.

Items  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment  that  have 
been retired from active use and are held for disposal 
are stated at the lower of their net book value or net 
realisable  value  and  are  shown  separately  in  the 
Consolidated financial statements.

Gains  or  losses  arising  from  disposal  or  retirement 
of  tangible  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com144

proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
are recognised net, within “Other Income” or “Other 
Expenses”,  as  the  case  maybe,  in  the  Consolidated 
Statement  of  profit  and  loss  in  the  year  of  disposal 
or retirement.

Capital  work-in-progress  are  Property,  plant  and 
equipment which are not yet ready for their intended 
use. Such assets are carried at cost comprising direct 
cost and related incidental expenses.

ii. Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent  expenditure  related  to  an  item  of 
Property, plant and equipment are added to its book 
value  only  if  it  increases  the  future  benefits  from 
the  existing  asset  beyond  its  previously  assessed 
standard of performance.

iii. Depreciation

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  a  straight-line  basis 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows. 
When  significant  parts  of  plant  and  equipment  are 
required  to  be  replaced  at  intervals,  the  Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives.

For the following categories of assets, Depreciation 
on Property, plant and equipment has been provided 
on  the  straight-line  method  as  per  the  useful  life 
prescribed  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 
2013.

Asset           

Estimated useful life

over the remaining 
period of the lease 
or estimated life, 
whichever is shorter

Electricals

Office premises    

60 years

The Company, based on technical assessment made 
by  technical  expert  and  management  estimate, 
depreciates  certain  items  of  building,  plant  and 
equipment and furniture and fixtures over estimated 
useful  lives  which  are  different  from  the  useful  life 
prescribed  in  Schedule  II  to  the  Companies  Act, 
2013. The management believes that these estimated 

useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation 
of  the  period  over  which  the  assets  are  likely  to  be 
used, as below:

Asset           

Estimated useful life

Vehicles            

Network & Servers 

5 years

4 years

All Property, plant and equipment costing less than 
`5,000  individually  are  fully  depreciated  in  the 
year  of  purchase.  Useful  lives  are  reviewed  at  each 
financial year end and adjusted if required.

iv. Reclassification to investment property

When  the  use  of  a  property  changes  from  owner-
occupied  to  investment  property,  the  property  is 
reclassified  as  investment  property  at  its  carrying 
amount on the date of reclassification.

3.9. (b) Intangible assets

i. Recognition and measurement

Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net 
of  accumulated  amortisation  and  accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Cost of an intangible asset 
includes  purchase  price,  non-refundable  taxes  and 
duties and any other directly attributable expenditure 
on making the asset ready for its intended use and 
net of any trade discounts and rebates.

ii. Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent  expenditure  on  an  intangible  asset  is 
charged to the Consolidated Consolidated Statement 
of profit and loss as an expense unless it is probable 
that  such  expenditure  will  enable  the  intangible 
asset  increase  the  future  benefits  from  the  existing 
asset  beyond  its  previously  assessed  standard  of 
performance and such expenditure can be measured 
and  attributed  to  the  intangible  asset  reliably,  in 
which case, such expenditure is capitalised.

Expenditure  on  software  development  eligible  for 
capitalisation are carried as Intangible assets under 
development where such assets are not yet ready for 
their intended use.

iii. Amortisation

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  The  amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed at 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS145

each reporting date. If the expected useful life of the 
asset is significantly different from previous estimates, 
the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

Gains  or  losses  arising  from  the  retirement  or 
disposal of an intangible asset are determined as the 
difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and 
the carrying amount of the asset and recognised as 
income or expense in the Consolidated Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss in the year of disposal.

The  estimated  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  used 

for amortisation are:

All  intangible  assets  costing  less  than  `5,000 
individually  are  fully  amortised  in  the  year  of 
acquisition.

3.11. Impairment of non-financial assets 

Assessment  is  done  at  each  reporting  date  as  to 
whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible 
and intangible) may be impaired. For the purpose of 
assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group 
of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets, is considered 
as a cash generating unit. If any such indication exists, 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset/
cash generating unit is made. Assets whose carrying 
value  exceeds  their  recoverable  amount  are  written 
down  to  the  recoverable  amount.  Recoverable 
amount  is  higher  of  an  asset’s  or  cash  generating 
unit’s net selling price and its value in use. Value in 
use  is  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash 
flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an 
asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. 
Assessment is also done at each reporting date as to 
whether  there  is  any  indication  that  an  impairment 
loss  recognised  for  an  asset  in  prior  accounting 
periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.

After impairment (if any), depreciation/ amortisation 
is  provided  on  the  revised  carrying  amount  of  the 
assets over its remaining life.

3.10. Investment property

3.12. Financial Instruments

Property  given  on  lease  to  earn  rental  income,  is 
classified as “Investment Property” as per requirement 
of  Ind  AS  40  “Investment  Property”.  Upon  initial 
recognition,  an  investment  property  is  measured  at 
cost.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  investment 
property  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any.

Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis to fully 
depreciate the assets using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

For the following categories of assets, Depreciation 
investment  property  has  been  provided  on  the 
straight-line method as per the useful life prescribed 

in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.

The fair values of investment property is disclosed in 
the note 11.

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or  equity  instrument  of  another  entity.  Financial 
instruments also include derivative contracts such as 
foreign currency forward contracts.

instruments  also  covers  contracts 

to 
Financial 
buy  or  sell  a  non-financial  item  that  can  be  settled 
net  in  cash  or  another  financial  instrument,  or  by 
exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts 
were  financial  instruments,  with  the  exception  of 
contracts that were entered into and continue to be 
held  for  the  purpose  of  the  receipt  or  delivery  of  a 
non-financial  item  in  accordance  with  the  entity’s 
expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.

I. Recognition and initial measurement

Trade  receivables,  Loans  and  deposits  are  initially 
recognised  when  they  are  originated.  All  other 
financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised 
when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  is  initially 
measured  at  fair  value  plus,  for  an  item  not  at  fair 
value  through  profit  and  loss  (‘FVTPL’),  transaction 
costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  its  acquisition 
or issued.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com146

II. Classification and subsequent measurement

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as 
measured at :

assets  are  measured  at  fair  value,  gains  and  losses 
are  either  recognized  entirely  in  the  statement  of 
profit and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss), or 
recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income).

-    Amortised cost;

-    Fair value through profit and loss (‘FVTPL’);

-   Fair value through other comprehensive income 

(‘FVOCI’)”

Financial  assets  (other  than  equity  instruments)
Financial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets. The Company classifies its financial 
assets in the following measurement categories:

Financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost 
A  financial  asset  that  meets  the  following  two 
conditions  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  (net  of 
any written down for impairment) unless the asset is 
designated at FVTPL under the fair value option.

Business model test: The objective of the Company’s 
business model is to hold the financial asset to collect 
the  contractual  cash  flows  (rather  than  to  sell  the 
instrument prior to its contractual maturity to realize 
its fair value changes).

Cash  flow  characteristics  test:  The  contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets (equity instruments)
Financial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets. The Company classifies its financial 
assets  in  the  following  measurement  categories: 

All  equity  instruments  are  to  be  measured  at 
FVTPL.
On initial recognition, a one time irrevocable choice 
for all equity instruments to designate the respective 
equity  instrument  as  Fair  Value  through  Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). All unrealized gains 
and  losses  are  recognised  in  OCI  and  on  disposal 
such  accumulated  gains  or  losses  are  transferred 
directly to retained earnings.

Financial assets measured at Fair Value

A financial asset which is not classified at amortized 
cost is subsequently meaured at fair valued. Where 

the  aforementioned 
The  assets  classified 
categories  are  subsequently  measured  as  follows: 

in 

a) Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
(FVTPL): These assets are subsequently measured at 
fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest 
or dividend income, are recognized in the statement 
of  profit  and  loss.  Financial  assets  that  are  held  for 
trading  and  whose  performance  is  evaluated  on  a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

b)  Financial  assets  at  Fair  Value  Through  Other 
Comprehensive  Income  (FVOCI):  These  assets  are 
subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income 
interest  method,  dividends 
under  the  effective 
(unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of 
part of the cost of the investment), foreign exchange 
gains  and  losses  and  impairment  are  recognised 
in  profit  or  loss.  Other  net  gains  and  losses  are 
recognised  in  OCI.  On  derecognition,  gains  and 
losses  accumulated  in  OCI  are  reclassified  to  profit 
or loss.

Financial Liabilities

Classification,  subsequent  measurement  and 
gains and losses 

Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at 
amortised  cost  or  FVTPL.  A  financial  liability  is 
classified  as  at  FVTPL  if  it  is  classified  as  held- 
for-  trading,  or  it  is  a  derivative  or  it  is  designated 
as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities 
at  FVTPL  are  measured  at  fair  value  and  net  gains 
and  losses,  including  any  interest  expense,  are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the  effective  interest  method.  Interest  expense  and 
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in 
profit  or  loss.  Any  gain  or  loss  on  derecognition  is 
also recognised in profit or loss.

III. Derecognition

Financial Assets

The  Company  derecognises  a  financial  asset  when 
the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the 
financial  asset  expire,  or  it  transfers  the  rights  to 
receive  the  contractual  cash  flows  in  a  transaction 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
147

in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership  of  the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or 
in  which  the  Company  neither  transfers  nor  retains 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
and does not retain control of the financial asset.

The  Company  enters  into  transactions  whereby  it 
transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but 
retains  either  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and 
rewards  of  the  transferred  assets,  the  transferred 
assets are not derecognised.

Financial liabilities

The  Company  derecognises  a  financial  liability 
when  its  contractual  obligations  are  discharged  or 
cancelled, or expire.

IV. Offsetting

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset 
and the net amount presented in the balance sheet 
when, and only when, the Company currently has a 
legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and 
it  intends  either  to  settle  them  on  a  net  basis  or  to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

V. Impairment

Overview of the ECL principles
The  Company  recognises 
expected credit losses on:

loss  allowances 

for 

-  financial assets measured at amortised cost; and
-  financial  assets  measured  at  FVOCI-  debt 

investments.

At  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses 
whether  financial  assets  carried  at  amortised  cost 
and  debt  securities  at  FVOCI  are  credit-  impaired. 
A  financial  asset  is  ‘credit-  impaired’  when  one  or 
more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the 
estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  financial  asset 
have occurred.

The  Company  considers  that  the  credit  risk  on  a 
financial asset has increased significantly if it is more 
than 90 days past due

3.13. Employee benefits

i) Short term employee benefits

Short  term  employee  benefits  include  salaries  and 
short term cash bonus. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash 
bonus  or  target  based  incentives  if  the  Company 
has a present legal or constrictive obligation to pay 

this  amount  as  a  result  of  past  service  provided  by 
the  employee,  and  the  obligation  can  be  estimated 
reliably.  These  costs  are  recognised  as  an  expense 
in the Consolidated Consolidated Statement of profit 
and  loss  at  the  undiscounted  amount  expected  to 
be paid over the period of services rendered by the 
employees to the Company.

ii) Defined-contribution plans

These  are  plans  in  which  the  Company  pays  pre-
defined  amounts  to  separate  funds  and  does  not 
have  any  legal  or  constrictive  obligation  to  pay 
additional sums. These comprise of contributions to 
the National pension scheme, employees’ provident 
fund  and  family  pension  fund.  The  Company’s 
payments  to  the  defined-contribution  plans  are 
reported as expenses during the period in which the 
employees  perform  the  services  that  the  payment 
covers.

iii) Defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plan is a post-employee benefit 
plan other than a defined contribution plan. Expenses 
for  defined-benefit  plan  in  the  nature  of  gratuity 
are  calculated  annualy  by  an  independent  actuary 
using  Projected  Unit  Credit  Method  (PUCM).  These 
commitments are valued at the present value of the 
expected  future  payments,  with  consideration  for 
calculated  future  salary  increases,  using  a  discount 
rate  corresponding  to  the  interest  rate  estimated 
by  the  actuary  having  regard  to  the  interest  rate 
on  government  bonds.  The  fair  values  of  the  plan 
assets  are  deducted  in  determining  the  net  liability. 
When  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets  exceeds  the 
commitments computed as aforesaid, the recognised 
asset is limited to the net total of any cumulative past 
service costs and the present value of any economic 
benefits available in the form of reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, 
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect 
of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any,  excluding  interest),  are 
recognised in OCI.

iv) Other long term employee benefits

Compensated absences which accrue to employees 
and which can be carried to future periods and are 
expected to be availed in more than twelve months 
immediately following the year in which the employee 
has  rendered  service  are  reported  as  expenses 
during the year in which the employees perform the 
services that the benefit covers and the liabilities are 
reported at the undiscounted amount of the benefits.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com148

v) Share-based payment transactions

Equity-settled  share-based  payments  to  employees 
that  are  granted  are  measured  by  reference  to  the 
fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant  date  of  the 
equity-settled sharebased payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the  Company’s  estimate  of  equity  instruments  that 
will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in 
equity. At the end of each period, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest based on the vesting conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.

vi) Other expenses

All other expenses are recognized in the period they 
accrue/occur.

3.14. Current and deferred tax

Tax  expense  for  the  period,  comprising  current  tax 
and deferred tax, are included in the determination 
of the net profit or loss for the period.

Current tax is measured at the amount of tax payable 
on  the  taxable  income  for  the  year  determined  in 
accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 
1961. The amount of current tax payable or receivable 
is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be 
paid  or  received  that  reflects  uncertainty  related  to 
income taxes, if any.

Deferred  tax  is  recognised  for  all  the  temporary 
differences,  being  the  differences  between  the 
taxable  income  and  the  accounting  income  that 
originate in one period and are capable of reversal in 
one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by  the  Balance  Sheet  date  and  reflects  uncertainty 
related to income taxes, if there is any. Deferred tax 
assets  are  recognised  and  carried  forward  only  to 
the extent it is probable that sufficient future taxable 
income will be available against which such deferred 
tax  assets  can  be  realised.  The  carrying  amount  of 
deferred  tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting 
date  and  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
to  allow  all  or  part  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  be 
utilised.  Unrecognised  deferred  tax  assets  are  re-
assessed at each reporting date and are recognised 
to the extent that it has become probable that future 
taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered.

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off 
the  recognised  amounts  and  there  is  an  intention 
to  settle  the  asset  and  the  liability  on  a  net  basis. 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set 
off  assets  against  liabilities  representing  current  tax 
and where the deferred tax assets and the deferred 
tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the 
same governing taxation laws.

3.15. Provisions and contingent liabilities

Provisions: Provisions are recognised when there is 
a present obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the 
obligation  and  there  is  a  reliable  estimate  of  the 
amount  of  the  obligation.  Provisions  are  measured 
at  the  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure  required  to 
settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  Balance  sheet 
date and are not discounted to its present value.

Contingent  Liabilities:  Contingent  liabilities  are 
disclosed  when  there 
is  a  possible  obligation 
arising  from  past  events,  the  existence  of  which 
will  be  confirmed  only  by  the  occurrence  or  non-
occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain  future  events 
not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company  or  a 
present obligation that arises from past events where 
it is either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made, is termed as a contingent 
liability.

Bank  Guarantee:  Bank  Guarantee  are  been  taken 
from banks and kept with exchanges as a margin to 
meet the margin obligation.

3.16. Cash and cash equivalents

In  the  Cash  Flow  Statement,  cash  and  cash 
equivalents include cash in hand, demand deposits 
and  short  term  deposit  with  banks  with  original 
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  and  other  short-
term  highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash and which 
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

3.17. Leases

The Company as lessee

The Company lease as set classes primarily consist 
of leases for office premises. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 
a  contract.  A  contract  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  if  the 
contract  conveys  the  right  to  control  the  use  of  an 

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.comSTATUTORY REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS149

identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:

(i)  the  contract  involves  the  use  of  an  identified 

asset

(ii)  the Company has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease and

(iii)  the Company has the right to direct the use of the 

asset.

At  the  date  of  commencement  of  the  lease,  the 
Company  recognizes  a  right-of-use  asset  (“ROU”) 
and  a  corresponding  lease  liability  for  all  lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee.

Certain  lease  arrangements  includes  the  options  to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.

The  right-of-use  assets  are  initially  recognized  at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior  to  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease  plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.

the 
Right-of-use  assets  are  depreciated 
commencement  date  on  a  straight-line  basis  over 
the  shorter  of  the  lease  term  and  useful  life  of  the 
underlying asset.

from 

The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country 
of  domicile  of  these  leases.  Lease  liabilities  are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.

Lease  liability  and  ROU  asset  have  been  separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.

3.18. Foreign currency

Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated 
into the functional currency of the Company at the 
exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions  or 
an average rate if the average rate approximates the 
actual rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency transactions are recorded on initial 
recognition  in  the  functional  currency,  using  the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items 
are reported using the closing exchange rate.

Exchange  differences  that  arise  on  settlement  of 
monetary items or on reporting at each closing date 
of  the  Company’s  monetary  items  at  the  closing 
rate are recognized as income and expenses in the 
period in which they arise. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency shall be translated into functional 
currency using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Exchange differences 
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

3.19. Earning per Share

The  basic  earnings  per  share  (‘EPS’)  is  computed 
by  dividing  the  net  profit  /  (loss)  after  tax  for  the 
year  attributable  to  the  equity  shareholders  by 
the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares 
outstanding during the year.

For  the  purpose  of  calculating  diluted  earnings  per 
share, net profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable 
to the equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year 
are  adjusted  for  the  effects  of  all  dilutive  potential 
equity shares.

3.20. Segment Reporting

The  Company’s  business  is  to  provide  broking 
services, to its clients, in the capital markets in India. 
All  other  activities  of  the  Company  are  ancillary  to 
the main business. As such, there are no reportable 
segments  that  need  to  be  reported  separately  as 
defined in Ind AS 108, Operating Segments.

3.21. Borrowing Costs

The  difference  between  the  discounted  amount 
mobilized  and  redemption  value  of  commercial 
papers  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of  profit  and 
loss over the life of the instrument with reference to 
effective interest rate method.

3.22. Dividend Policy

The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend 
to equity holders of the parent when the distribution 
is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company.

year – `381 lacs). 

C. Other long term employee benefits

A sum of `394 lacs (Previous Year `148 lacs) has been charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss towards Compensation 
Absence [Refer Note No. 33] 

Note 40: Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.

Company as a lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for premises and leasehold improvements. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right 
to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease 
liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term 
leases) and low value leases (underlying asset of less than `1,50,000). For these short-term and low value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company 
has recognised `NIL towards short-term lease and `NIL towards low value assets during the year ended 31 March 2025. The 
Company has recognised `1,132 lacs (previous year –`1,088 lacs) towards the leases pertaining to the locations which are not 
separately identifiable units.

Certain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com 
 
 
 
 
 
 
172

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
prepaid lease plus any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of the Company. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding 
adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments of `1,325 lacs (previous 
year – `1,305 lacs) have been classified as financing cash flows. 

Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The 
Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term. 
The Company has recognised `NIL towards income from sub-lease.

Note 42: Segment Reporting

The Company’s business is to provide brokerage services to its clients in the capital markets within India. All other activities of the 
Company revolve around the main business. As such, there are no separate reportable segments as per the Ind AS on Operating 
Segment (Ind AS 108), specified under the Companies Act, 2013. The necessary information to report the revenues from the 
external customers for each product and service, or each group of similar products and service is not available and the cost 
to develop it would be excessive. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews the operations of the Company as one 
operating segment. Hence no separate segment information has been furnished herewith. Similarly, the geographical information 
related to the revenue from the external customers attributed to the entity’s country of domicile and to all other foreign countries 
in total is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive. No single customer accounts for the revenue, which is equal 
or more than ten percent of the total revenue of the entity, hence no such segment could be identified.

2. Fair Value hierarchy

The following is the hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 

3. Valuation techniques used to determine fair value

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments includes investment in equity investment valued at 
quoted closing price on stock exchange / other basis based on materiality. 

Transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3
There were no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3.

4. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
Financial assets not measured at fair value includes cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and other 
financial assets. These are financial assets whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, due to their short-term 
nature.

Additionally, financial liabilities such as trade payables and other financial liabilities are not measured at FVTPL, 
whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, because of their short-term nature. 

B. Financial risk management

Company has operations in India. Whilst risk is inherent in the Company’s activities, it is managed through an 
integrated risk management framework, including ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to 
risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Company’s continuing profitability 
and each individual within the Company is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities. 
The Company is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. It is also subject to various operating and 
business risks. 

a. Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incurr a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge 
their contractual obligation. The Company manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it 
is willing to accept for individual counterparties, and by monitoring exposures in relations to such limits.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for each class of financial instruments is the carrying amount of that class of 
financial instruments presented in the financial statements. The Company’s major classes of financial assets are 
cash and cash equivalents, loans, investment in mutual fund units & Government Securities, term deposits, trade 
receivables and security deposits.

Deposits with banks are considered to have negligible risk or nil risk, as they are maintained with high rated banks/
financial institutions as approved by the Board of directors

Investments include investment in liquid mutual fund units that are marketable securities of eligible financial 
institutions for a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic credit rating agencies.

The management has established accounts receivable policy under which customer accounts are regularly 
monitored. The Company has a dedicated risk management team, which monitors the positions, exposures and 
margins on a continuous basis.

Expected Credit Loss (ECL):  
For the purpose of computation of ECL, the term default implies an event where amount due towards margin 
requirement and / or mark to market losses for which the client was unable to provide funds / collaterals to bridge 
the shortfall, the same is termed as margin call triggered.

For arriving at the ECL, the Company follows ECL model as approved by board. 

3. Staging Definition:- 
For the purpose of the computation of Expected credit losses, three stages have been defined as below:- 
Stage 1:- Client having open positions in MTF (Margin Trading Funding).  
Stage 2:- The dues /debits, post position square off, which are outstanding for more than 2 days but less than 30 
days. 
Stage 3:- The dues /debits, post position square off, which are outstanding for more than 30 days. 

Computation of Expected Credit Losses for MTF:- 
As per Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 109 on Financial Instruments, an entity shall recognise a loss allowance 
for expected credit losses on a financial asset and shall measure the loss allowance for a financial instrument. 

Based on the above, expected credit loss has been computed taking into consideration the the probability of the 
borrower default (PD), expected exposure at the time when the borrower defaults (EAD), the expected loss as a 
percentage of the EAD, conditional on the borrower defaulting LGD (Loss given default).

Expected Credit loss model has been used to recognize the provision (or credit losses) based on expected losses 
at client level having open position in MTF as on reporting date. The expected loss at client level is calculated as 
follows:  
EL = PD × LGD × EAD  
The final aggregate amount is computed to arrive at Final Expected Credit Loss (ECL) across HSL.

The fundamental of the above parameters used are as follows:- 
PD: the probability of the borrower default 
EAD: expected exposure at the time when the borrower defaults (Exposure at default) 
LGD: the expected loss as a percentage of the EAD, conditional on the borrower defaulting (Loss given default) 
EL: Expected loss

ECL for Trade Receivables (broking clients) :- 
For Trade Receivables (Equity and Derivative Products), current policy of providing 100% for all outstanding debits 
where the dues are not recoverable (uncovered position after square off), or, is outstanding for more than 90 days 
is being followed.

ECL for Trade Receivable (Third Party Products Receivables):- 
For Trade receivables of Third Party Products, any amount which is not received within 90 days is 100% provided 
for, except for the receivables which pertain to any HDFC group company, or to any Exchange to regulator related 
receivables. 

ECL on ESOP Funding: 
All the clients to whom ESOP funding is offered are the trading clients only. Similar treatment of MTF as described 
above, will be given to the outstanding amount on ESOP funding clients also.

b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The entity’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as 
possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the entity’s reputation.

Prudent liquidity risk management requires sufficient cash and marketable securities and availability of funds through adequate 
committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions.

The Company has a view of maintaining liquidity with minimal risks while making investments. The Company invests its surplus 
funds in short term liquid assets in bank deposits and liquid mutual funds. The Company monitors its cash and bank balances 
periodically in view of its short term obligations associated with its financial liabilities.

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future Cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, 
while optimizing the return.

i. Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company does not have any foreign currency exposure as at each reporting date. 
Accordingly, foreign currency risk disclosure is not applicable. 

ii. Interest rate risk 
The Company is exposed to Interest risk if the fair value or future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate as a result 
of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing 
investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. 

The Company’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings, interest bearing deposits with bank and loans given to customers. Such 
instruments expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. Management believe that the interest rate risk attached to this 
financial assets are not significant due to the nature of this financial assets. All the borrowings of the company are fixed interest 
rate bearing instruments and hence there is no impact of movement in interest rate. 

iii. Market price risks 
The Company is exposed to market price risk, which arises from FVTPL investment in mutual funds. The management monitors 
the proportion of mutual fund investments in its investment portfolio based on market indices. Material investments within the 
portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the appropriate authority.

ognised upon allotment of the securities to the applicant or as the case may be, on issue of the insurance policy 
to the applicant after deducting claw back amount as per the agreed terms. Commissions and fees recognised as 
aforesaid are exclusive of goods and service tax, securities transaction tax, stamp duties and other levies by SEBI 
and stock exchanges.

Interest Income - Interest is earned on delayed payments from clients and amounts funded to them. Interest in-
come is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding from customers or on

i.  SUN System ERP (Accounting Software): 

Since inception, the audit trail functionality has been activated to critical financial tables ensuring transparency 
and accountability in our financial record-keeping Systems. The snapshot of the enabled tables have been 
furnished during audit. 
Audit logs have consistently been generated, providing a comprehensive trail of financial transactions and 
activities. 
The activation of audit functionality has been integral to our internal control framework, facilitating compliance 
with regulatory requirements and enhancing stakeholder confidence. 

The Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account which has a feature of 
recording audit trail (edit log) facility, the audit log was enabled and operated throughout the year for relevant 
transactions recorded in SUN accounting software.

Precision (Trading backend system):
Immutability of Submitted Entries:-

  Once an entry is submitted, it cannot be modified, and there is no front-end screen available for modifications, 

ensuring the integrity and reliability of entered data.

Limited Access to DBA Changes:- Access to Database Administrator (DBA) changes is restricted to a select 
group of individuals, following the four-eye principle with multiple reviews to prevent inadvertent command 
execution.

  Data Model Security:- The data model and know-how are exclusively maintained by TCS (Tata Consultancy 
Services), ensuring that only authorized patches provided by TCS are applied, thus mitigating the risk of 
unauthorized data tampering. 

Functional Role Assignment: 
Functional roles are assigned to application users in the back-office application, grouping various screens. 
Access to screens are granted based on these assigned roles.

ANNUAL REPORT: 2024-25www.hdfcsec.com 
 
 
 
 
192

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):-Access to screens is contingent upon the assignment of roles, which are 
maintained within the database. Additionally, the system logs the date and time stamp of any modifications to 
these role assignments.

Transaction Logging:- All financial transactions are recorded in the financial ledger with an insert-only option; 
there is no provision for updates or deletes. Once data is entered into the table, it becomes permanent and 
immutable. The system automatically captures metadata such as “created by,” “create date,” and “program ID,” 
facilitating traceability and accountability.

The robust controls and mitigation measures implemented within the Precision system provide a strong 
foundation for preventing data tampering and ensuring the integrity of financial transactions. These measures, 
including the immutability of submitted entries, restricted access to DBA changes, and thorough transaction 
logging, contribute to a secure and reliable data environment. We are confident that these controls effectively 
mitigate the risks associated with data tampering and support the integrity of our financial reporting processes.

The Company has used accounting softwares SUN and Precision for maintaining its books of account which 
has a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all 
relevant transactions recorded in the software. Audit log enabled within the production database of SUN and 
Precision on August 16, 2024 and March 21, 2025 respectively to record or track the database management 
layer (“DML”) statements (insert, update, delete) executed by the database administrator. However, management 
is not in possession of complete data to determine whether audit trail feature of the said software was enabled 
and operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded in the software or whether there were 
any instances of the audit trail feature being tampered with, in respect of an accounting software(s) where the 
audit trail has been enabled. Additionally, the audit trail in respect of the financial years 2024-2025 and 2023-
2024 has been preserved by the company to the extent possible as per the statutory requirements for record 
retention.

j.  The Company has complied with the requirements of the number of layers prescribed under Section 2(87) of 

the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Restriction on number of Layers) Rules, 2017.
