1. Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following
methods and print the final salary.
1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of
employee as
parameter
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds Rs 500 to the salary of the employee if it is less

2. A Student is an object in a university management System. Analyze the
concept and identify the data members that a Student class should have.
Also analyze the behavior of student in a university management System
and identify the methods that should be included in Student class.
3. Create a class named Pizza that stores information about a single pizza. It
should contain the following:
Private instance variables to store the size of the pizza (either small,
medium, or large), the number of cheese toppings, the number of
pepperoni toppings, and the number of ham toppings.
Constructor(s) that set all of the instance variables.
Public methods to get and set the instance variables.
A public method named calcCost( ) that returns a double that is the
cost of the pizza. Pizza cost is determined by:
Small: $10 + $2 per topping
Medium: $12 + $2 per topping
Large: $14 + $2 per topping
public method named getDescription( ) that returns a String
containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping.
Write test code to create several pizzas and output their descriptions. For
example, a large pizza with one cheese, one pepperoni and two ham
toppings should cost a total of $22. Now Create a PizzaOrder class that
allows up to three pizzas to be saved in an order. Each pizza saved should
be a Pizza object. Create a method calcTotal() that returns the cost of order.
