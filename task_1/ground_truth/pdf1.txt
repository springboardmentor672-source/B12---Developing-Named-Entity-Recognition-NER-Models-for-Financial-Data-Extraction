Assignment on OOPs Concept
Problem: Building a Library System
Create a simple library system that models books, authors, and library users. Your system should incorporate the following OOP concepts:
**Book Class**:
- Attributes: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `availableCopies`, `totalCopies`, etc.
- Methods: `borrow()`, `returnBook()`, `isAvailable()`, etc.
**Author Class**:
- Attributes: `name`, `birthDate`, `biography`, etc.
- Methods: `getAuthorInfo()`, etc.
**LibraryUser Class**:
- Attributes: `userId`, `name`, `userType`, etc.
- Methods: `displayInfo()`, `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, etc.
**Student Class** (Inherits from `LibraryUser`):
- Additional attributes: `studentId`, `yearOfStudy`, etc.
- Override `displayInfo()` to include student-specific information.
**Professor Class** (Inherits from `LibraryUser`):
- Additional attributes: `employeeId`, `department`, etc.
- Override `displayInfo()` to include professor-specific information.
Your program should allow users to:
- Add and remove books from the library system.
- Borrow and return books, updating the available copies accordingly.
- Display information about books, authors, and users.
- Handle different user types (students, professors) appropriately.
