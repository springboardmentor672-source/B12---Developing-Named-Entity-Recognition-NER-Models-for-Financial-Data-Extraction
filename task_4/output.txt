STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 1 Background Tata Industries Limited TIL was incorporated on April 7 1945 at Mumbai under the Companies Act VII of 1913 and has been carrying on the business of an investment holding company engaged in the incubation / promotion of new business ventures From April 2012 onwards TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company CIC by the Reserve Bank of India RBI on account of its investments being made prominently in other Tata companies Earlier it was registered with RBI as a NonBanking Financial Company Besides carrying out investment activities from Head office TIL has three operating divisions engaged into management consultancy data analytics business and healthcare solutions The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 and authorised for issue on 29 April 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements A Statement of compliance These Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 the Act read with Companies Indian Accounting Standards Rules as amended from time to time other relevant provisions of the Act and the Prudential norms directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India as applicable to Core Investment Companies B Functional and presentation currency These Standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees INR which is also Companys functional currency All amounts have been roundedoff to the nearest lakhs unless otherwise indicated C Basis of preparation The standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements Continued D Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented Actual results may differ from these estimates Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below i Useful lives of property plant and equipment and intangible assets Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 In cases where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II they are based on technical advice considering the nature of the asset the estimated usage of the asset the operating conditions of the asset past history of replacement anticipated technological changes manufacturers warranties and maintenance support Assumptions are also made when the Company assesses whether an asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised ii Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations The obligation arising from defined benefit plan and other longterm employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the postemployment benefit obligations image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements Continued iii Recognition of deferred tax assets Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change iv Revenue recognition The Company uses the percentageofcompletion method in accounting for its fixedprice contracts Use of the percentageof completion method requires the Company to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity Provisions for estimated losses if any on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date v Impairment of trade receivables The Company reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular intervals The Companys credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables In determining whether impairment losses should be reported in the statement of profit and loss the Company makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows Accordingly an allowance for expected credit loss is made where there is an identified loss event or condition which based on previous experience is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows vi Impairment losses on investments The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised cost annually or more frequently when there is indication for impairment If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount the impairment loss is accounted for NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements Continued E Measurement of fair values The Companys accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values which includes overseeing all significant fair value measurement including Level 3 fair values by the management The management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments If third party information such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure fair values then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability the Company uses observable market data as far as possible Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement The Company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred 3 Material accounting policies A Foreign currency translation On initial recognition all foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction As at the reporting date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments 2 i Investments and other financial assets Classification The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories i those to be measured subsequently at fair value either through other comprehensive income OCI or through profit and loss and 2 ii those measured at amortised cost The classification depends on the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows For assets measured at fair value gains and losses will either be recorded in statement of profit and loss or OCI For investments in debt instruments this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held For investment in equity instruments this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through OCI The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes Debt instruments At initial recognition the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Companys business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments Amortised cost Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued 3 i Investments and other financial assets Continued Fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets where the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss When the financial asset is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ losses within other income or other expense Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/losses within other income or other expense in the period in which it arises Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income Equity instruments The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value Where the Companys management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss Dividends from such investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Other Income when the Companys right to receive payments is established Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as gains/ losses in the Statement of Profit and Loss Impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses on equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued 3 i Investments and other financial assets Continued Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised only when the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients Where the Company transfers an asset it evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset Where the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership the financial asset is derecognised Where the Company has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset the financial asset is not derecognised Where the Company has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset the financial asset is derecognised if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset Where the Company retains control of the financial asset the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset ii Debt and equity instruments liabilities Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued iii Financial liabilities The Companys financial liabilities comprise borrowings trade payables and other liabilities These are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or where appropriate a shorter period Changes to the carrying amount of a financial liability as a result of renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of the financial liability is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when and only when its obligations are discharged cancelled or they expire iv Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures Derivative instruments are initially measured at fair value Subsequent to initial recognition derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates At inception of designated hedging relationships the Company documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge The Company also documents the economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other Cash Flow Hedge When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives is image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued iv Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Continued recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under effective portion of cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge item determined on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold expires is terminated or is exercised then the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively When the hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued the amount that has been accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in profit and loss v Financial guarantee contracts The Company on a case to case basis elects to account for financial guarantee contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract as specified in Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments and Ind AS 104 on Insurance Contracts The Company has regarded all its financial guarantee contracts as insurance contracts At the end of each reporting period the Company performs a liability adequacy test ie it assesses the likelihood of a payout based on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows and any deficiency is recognized in profit or loss vi Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a legally enforceable right not contingent on future events to offset the recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued C Property plant and equipment Recognition and measurement All items of property plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced All other repairs and maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred The cost of a selfconstructed item of property plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress account At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property plant and equipment Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and the asset is ready for its intended use Depreciation on tangible fixed assets of the Company has been provided on Straight Line Method SLM considering the useful lives and residual value prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 except in respect of the following categories of assets in whose case the life of the assets has been assessed as under based on technical advice taking into account the nature of

unless a products technical feasibility has been established in which case such expenditure is capitalized The amount capitalized comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating producing and making the asset ready for its intended use Property plant and equipment utilized for research and development are capitalized and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for the property plant and equipment E Investment property Recognition and measurement Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued E Investment property Continued in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes Upon initial recognition an investment property is measured at cost including related transaction costs Subsequent to initial recognition investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item is recognised in profit or loss Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably Depreciation Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice the management believes a period of 60 years representing the best estimate of the period over which investment property which is quite similar is expected to be used Accordingly the company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a straightline basis Reclassification from / to investment property Transfers to or from investment property are made only when there is a change in use Transfers between investment property owneroccupied property and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure purposes Fair value disclosure The fair values of investment property is disclosed in the notes Fair values is determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued F Inventories Stockintrade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale Cost of traded goods is determined on FirstinFirst out FIFO basis and includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item by item basis Provision is made for the cost of obsolescence and other anticipated losses whenever considered necessary G Impairment Impairment of financial instruments other than at fair value The Company assesses on a forwardlooking basis the expected credit loss associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk For trade receivables only the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables Impairment of nonfinancial assets The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired If any indication of such impairment exists the recoverable amount of such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount an impairment is recognised The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss H Noncurrent assets or disposal group held for sale Noncurrent assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued H Noncurrent assets or disposal group held for sale

Shortterm employee benefits All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as shortterm employee benefits These benefits include compensated absences such as paid annual leave The undiscounted amount of shortterm employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised during the year Defined Contribution plans The Company makes monthly contributions to the Superannuation fund and National pension scheme for all qualifying employees until retirement or resignation of the employee The Company recognizes such contributions as an expense when incurred The Company has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution Defined benefit plans The Company operates the postemployment schemes such as Gratuity Provident fund and postretirement medical benefits PRMB and Pension to an exdirector which are defined benefit plans The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued I Employee benefits Continued The actuarial valuation method carried out by an independent actuary used for measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee to employees Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans since the Company is obliged to meet interest shortfall if any with respect to covered employees The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in the other comprehensive income Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service cost Other longterm employee benefits The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation Remeasurement as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement of profit and loss The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting period regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued J Revenue recognition The Company has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether how much and when revenue is to be recognised Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in exchange for those products or services The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services Specifically the standard introduces a 5step approach to revenue recognition Step 1 Identify the contracts with a customer Step 2 Identify the performance obligation in contract Step 3 Determine the transaction price Step 4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5 Recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation Under Ind AS 115 an entity recognises revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied ie when control of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer Rendering of services In respect of contracts revenue on timeandmaterial contracts are recognized as the related services are performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue Revenue from fixedprice fixedtime frame contracts where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration is recognized as per the percentageofcompletion method Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion Projected losses if any are provided in entirety as per Ind AS based on managements current estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of technical assessment of time and effort required and estimates of future expenditure image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued J Revenue recognition Continued Revenue is measured based on the transaction price which is the consideration adjusted for volume discounts service level credits performance bonuses price concessions and incentives if any as specified in the contract with the customer Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets which are referred to as unbilled revenue while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities which are referred to as unearned revenues Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables only act of invoicing is pending when there is unconditional right to receive cash and only passage of time is required as per contractual terms Unearned and deferred revenue contract liability is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues Sale of goods Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods to the customer Sales are recorded net of returns if any trade discounts rebates and goods and service tax Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of the customer contract except in case where the amortisation period is one year or less in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred Interest income Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate method The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset When calculating the effective interest rate the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instruments for example prepayment extension but does not consider the expected credit loss Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Companys right to receive payment is established NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Leases A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration Company as a lessee The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from nonlease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the nonlease components The Company recognises rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date The cost of the rightofuse asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located The rightofuse assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation accumulated impairment losses if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability The rightofuse assets is depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of rightofuse asset The estimated useful lives of rightofuse assets are determined on the same basis as those of property plant and equipment Rightofuse assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable Impairment loss if any is recognised in the statement of profit and loss The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined If that rate cannot be readily determined the Company uses incremental borrowing rate For leases with reasonably similar characteristics the Company on a lease by lease basis may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole The lease payments shall include fixed payments variable lease payments residual value guarantees exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Leases Continued The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised insubstance fixed lease payments The Company recognises the amount of the remeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the rightofuse asset Where the carrying amount of the rightofuse asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in statement of profit and loss The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to shortterm leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term Company as a lessor At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight line basis over the lease term In case of a finance lease finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessors net investment in the lease When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately It assesses the lease classification of a sublease with reference to the rightofuse asset arising from the head lease not with reference to the underlying asset If a head lease is a short term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above then it classifies the sublease as an operating lease If an arrangement contains lease and nonlease components the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 effective annual reporting period beginning April 1 2019 and applied the standard to its leases retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard recognised on the date of initial application April 1 2019 NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Leases Continued Accordingly the Company has not restated comparative information instead the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as on April 1 2019 The company has applied the Covid 19 related concession amendment to Ind AS 116 The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and will affect the current amp future periods only L Income Tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty if any related to income taxes It is measured using tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction a temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued L Income Tax Continued b taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available Therefore in case of a history of recent losses the Company recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realised Deferred tax assets unrecognised or recognised are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects at the reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill related to that acquisition if they result from new information obtained about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain purchase gains All other acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in profit or loss NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued M Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Companys business the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Company and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and a is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or b is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale if earlier When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation the comparative statement of profit and loss is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period N Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are interest and other costs including exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred O Operating Segments An operating Segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relates to transactions with any of Companys other components and for which discrete financial information is available All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Companys Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their performance P Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued Q Business combinations Business combinations under common control Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted in accordance with Pooling of Interest Method laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 Ind AS 103 Business combinations of entities under common control notified under the Companies Act 2013 All assets liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books of account of the Company at their existing carrying amounts Intercompany balances are eliminated The difference between the investments held by the Company and all assets liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recognised in capital reserve and presented separately from other capital reserves Comparative accounting period presented in the financial statements of the Company has been restated for the accounting impact of the merger as stated above as if the merger had occurred from the beginning of the comparative period in the financial statements Any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net identifiable assets This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis Business combinations not under common control Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree For each business combination the Company elects whether to measure the noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred At the acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values For this purpose the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable When the Company acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued Q Business combinations Continued with the contractual terms economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109 it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for noncontrolling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve However if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve without routing the same through OCI If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete Those provisional amounts are adjusted through goodwill during the measurement period or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that if known would have affected the amounts recognised at that date These adjustments are called as measurement period adjustments The measurement period does not exceed one year from the acquisition date After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses For the purpose of impairment

as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued Q Business combinations Continued Companys cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods Where goodwill has been allocated to a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained R Provisions and contingencies A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost Expected future operating losses are not provided for A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract Before such a provision is made the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract NOTES TO

value grouped into Level 1 to Level 3 as described below Quoted prices in an active market Level 1 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares Valuation techniques with observable inputs Level 2 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices This level of hierarchy includes derivative contracts Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data This level of hierarchy includes investments in unquoted equity shares and preference shares C Valuation technique to determine fair value The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments i Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables loans measured at amortised cost trade and other payables borrowings other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values due to their predominant short term nature ii Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price quotations as on 31 March Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading Instead they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose Upon the application of Ind AS 109 the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments at FVOCI as the directors believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long term strategic investments than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 Currency Indian rupees in lakhs 39 Financial instruments Continued C Valuation technique to determine fair value Continued iii Investments in unquoted preference shares carried at fair value are based on discounted cash flow approach The valuation model considers the present value of expected cash inflows discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate iv Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments However there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique v There have been no transfers between Level 1 Level 2 and Level 3 for the year ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 40 Financial Risk Management The Company

1913 and has been carrying on the business of an investment holding company engaged in the incubation / promotion of new business ventures From April 2012 onwards TIL is categorised as a Core Investment Company CIC by the Reserve Bank of India RBI on account of its investments being made prominently in other Tata companies Earlier it was registered with RBI as a NonBanking Financial Company Besides carrying out investment activities from Head office TIL has three operating divisions engaged into management consultancy data analytics business and healthcare solutions These are the consolidated financial statements of TIL and its subsidiaries collectively the Group and joint ventures and associate companies are mentioned in Note 56 of the financials The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 and authorised for issue on 03 May 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation A Statement of compliance The Consolidated Financial Statements CFS comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards Ind AS notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 the 2013 Act read with Rule 3 of Companies Indian Accounting Standards Rules 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act B Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees INR which is also TILs functional currency All amounts have been roundedoff to the nearest lakhs unless otherwise indicated C Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation Continued D Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company its subsidiaries and the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates as at the reporting date Subsidiaries Subsidiaries include all the entities over which the Group has control The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns through its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements listed above Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases Intercompany transactions and balances including unrealised profits are eliminated in full on consolidation Noncontrolling interests in the net assets excluding goodwill of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Companys equity The interest of noncontrolling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis Subsequent to acquisition the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the noncontrolling interests share of subsequent changes in equity Total comprehensive income is attributed to noncontrolling interests even if it results in the noncontrolling interest having a deficit balance Changes in the Companys interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions The carrying amount of the Companys interests and the noncontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries Any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company When the Company loses control of a subsidiary the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between i the aggregate of the fair value of NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of

of any retained interest and ii the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary and any noncontrolling interests Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for ie reclassified to profit or loss in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed off The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IndAS 109 Financial Instruments or when applicable the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity Joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement The results assets and liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting A Joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control Joint control is considered when there is contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint venture The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control those policies Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity The results assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in

2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation Continued D Basis of consolidation Continued Equity method of accounting equity accounted investees An interest in an associate or joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date in which the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture and are recognised initially at cost The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment losses The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of profits or losses and equity movements of equity accounted investees from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee the carrying amount of that interest including any longterm investments in the nature of net investments is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee Dividend received or receivable from associates and jointventures are recognised as a reduction in carrying amount of the investment The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in Note 2E below Changes in the proportion held by NCI Changes in the proportion of the equity held by NCI are accounted for as equity transactions The carrying amount of the controlling interests and NCI are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries Any difference between the amount by which the NCI are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Group E Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these Ind AS consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented Actual results may differ from these estimates NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation Continued E Use of estimates and judgements Continued Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below i Useful lives of property plant and equipment and intangible assets Determination is done to evaluate the estimated useful lives of tangible assets and also assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 In cases where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II they are based on technical advice considering the nature of the asset the estimated usage of the asset the operating conditions of the asset past history of replacement anticipated technological changes manufacturers warranties and maintenance support Assumptions also need to be made when the Group assesses whether an asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised ii Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations The obligation arising from defined benefit plan and other longterm employment benefits is determined based on actuarial assumptions Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the postemployment benefit obligations iii Recognition of deferred tax assets Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation Continued E Use of estimates and judgements Continued The amount of total deferred tax assets could change if estimates of projected future taxable income or if tax regulations undergo a change iv Revenue recognition The Group uses the percentageofcompletion method in accounting for its fixedprice contracts Use of the percentageof completion method requires the Group to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity Provisions for estimated losses if any on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date v Impairment of trade receivables The Group reviews its trade receivables to assess impairment at regular intervals The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables In determining whether impairment losses should be reported in the statement of profit and loss the Group makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows Accordingly an allowance for expected credit loss is made where there is an identified loss event or condition which based on previous experience is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows vi Impairment losses on investments The Group reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised cost annually or more frequently when there is indication for impairment If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount the impairment loss is accounted for F Measurement of fair values The Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 2 Summary of statement of compliance basis of preparation and presentation critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgements and basis of consolidation Continued F Measurement of fair values Continued The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values which includes overseeing all significant fair value measurement including level 3 fair values by the management The management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments If third party information such as broker quotes or pricing services is used to measure fair values then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability the Group uses observable market data as far as possible Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred 3 Material accounting policies A Foreign currency translation On initial recognition all foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction As at the reporting date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments 2 i Investments and other financial assets Classification The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories i those to be measured subsequently at fair value either through other comprehensive income OCI or through profit and loss and 2 ii those measured at amortised cost The classification depends on the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows For assets measured at fair value gains and losses will either be recorded in statement of profit and loss or OCI For investments in debt instruments this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held For investment in equity instruments this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through OCI The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes Debt instruments At initial recognition the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Groups business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments Amortised cost Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued 3 i Investments and other financial assets Continued Fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets where the assets cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses interest revenue and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss When the financial asset is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised as gains/ losses within other income or other expense Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method Fair value through profit or loss FVTPL Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the Statement of Profit and Loss as gains/losses within other income or other expense in the period in which it arises Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income Equity instruments The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value Where the Groups management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and Loss Dividends from such investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as Other Income when the Groups right to receive payments is established Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised as gains/losses within other income or other expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss Impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses on equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting

derecognised only when the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients Where the Group transfers an asset it evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset Where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership the financial asset is derecognised Where the Group has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset the financial asset is not derecognised Where the Group has neither transferred a financial asset nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset Where the Group retains control of the financial asset the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset i Debt and equity instruments liabilities Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs ii Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities comprise borrowings trade payables and other liabilities These are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued 2 ii Financial liabilities Continued The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or where appropriate a shorter period Changes to the carrying amount of a financial liability as a result of renegotiation or modification of terms that do not result in derecognition of the financial liability is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when its obligations are discharged cancelled or they expire iii Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures Derivative instruments are initially measured at fair value Subsequent to initial recognition derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit and loss The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates At inception of designated hedging relationships the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge The Group also documents the economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other Cash Flow Hedge When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the other equity under effective portion of cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in the OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge item determined on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit and loss image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued B Financial instruments Continued iii Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Continued The amount accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold expires is terminated or is exercised then the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively When the hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued the amount that has been accumulated in other equity is reclassified to profit and loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit and loss If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in profit and loss iv Financial guarantee contracts The Group on a case to case basis elects to account for financial guarantee contracts as a financial instrument or as an insurance contract as specified in Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments and Ind AS 104 on Insurance Contracts The Group has regarded all its financial guarantee contracts as insurance contracts At the end of each reporting period the Group performs a liability adequacy test ie it assesses the likelihood of a payout based on current undiscounted estimates of future cash flows and any deficiency is recognized in profit or loss v Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when it currently has a legally enforceable right not contingent on future events to offset the recognised amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously C Property Plant and Equipment Recognition and measurement All items of property plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably The carrying amount of any component accounted for NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued C Property plant and equipment Continued as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced All other repairs and maintenance are charged to statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred The cost of a selfconstructed item of property plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labor any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss Assets in the course of construction are capitalized in capital work in progress account At the point when an asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property plant and equipment Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised until the period of commissioning has been completed and the asset is ready for its intended use

is capitalized The amount capitalized comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating producing and making the asset ready for its intended use Fixed assets utilized for research and development are capitalized and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for the property plant and equipment E Investment property Recognition and measurement Investment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both but not for sale in the ordinary course of business use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes Upon initial recognition an investment property is measured at cost including related transaction costs Subsequent to initial recognition investment property is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal Any gain or loss on disposal of investment property calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item is recognised in profit or loss Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably Depreciation Based on technical evaluation and consequent advice the management believes a period of 60 years representing the best estimate of the period over which investment property which is quite similar is expected to be used Accordingly the company depreciates investment property over a period of 60 years on a straightline basis image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued E Investment property Continued Reclassification from / to investment property Transfers to or from investment property are made only when there is a change in use Transfers between investment property owneroccupied property and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure purposes Fair value disclosure The fair values of investment property is disclosed in the notes Fair values is determined by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued F Inventories Stockintrade is valued at cost and net realisable value whichever is lower Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale Cost of traded goods is determined on FirstinFirst out FIFO basis and includes the cost of purchases and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item by item basis Provision is made for the cost of obsolescence and other anticipated losses whenever considered necessary G Impairment Impairment of financial instruments other than at fair value The Group assesses on a forwardlooking basis the expected credit loss associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk For trade receivables only the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables Impairment of nonfinancial assets The carrying values of assets / cash generating units at each Balance Sheet date are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired If any indication of such impairment exists the recoverable amount of such assets / cash generating unit is estimated and in case the carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount an impairment is recognised NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued G Impairment Continued The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and their value in use Value in use is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their present value based on an appropriate discount factor Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods no longer exists or may have decreased such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss H Noncurrent assets or disposal group held for sale Noncurrent assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use Such assets or disposal groups are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell Any resultant loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis except that no loss is allocated to inventories financial assets deferred tax assets employee benefit assets and biological assets which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups other accounting policies Losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss Once classified as heldforsale intangible assets property plant and equipment and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated I Employee benefits Shortterm employee benefits All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as shortterm employee benefits These benefits include compensated absences such as paid annual leave The undiscounted amount of shortterm employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised during the year Defined Contribution plans The Group makes monthly contributions to the Superannuation fund and National pension scheme for all qualifying employees until retirement or resignation of the employee The Group recognizes such contributions as an expense when incurred The Group has no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued I Employee benefits Continued Defined benefit plans The Group operates the postemployment schemes such as Gratuity Provident fund and Postretirement medical benefits PRMB and Pension to an exdirector which are defined benefit plans The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method The actuarial valuation method carried out by an independent actuary used for measuring the liability for provident Fund is Projected Accrued Benefit method This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee to employees Provident fund trusts are treated as Defined Benefit Plans since the Group is obliged to meet interest shortfall if any with respect to covered employees The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur directly in the other comprehensive income Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or enhancements are recognised in profit and loss as past service cost Other longterm employee benefits The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued I Employee benefits Continued to the terms of the related obligation Remeasurement as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement of profit and loss Other longterm employee benefits Continued The obligations are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet after the reporting period regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur J Provisions A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost Expected future operating losses are not provided for A contract is considered to be onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract Before such a provision is made the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract K Revenue recognition The Group has applied Ind AS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether how much and when revenue is to be recognised Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to receive in exchange for those products or services The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Revenue recognition Continued reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services Specifically the standard introduces a 5step approach to revenue recognition Step 1 Identify the contracts with a customer Step 2 Identify the performance obligation in contract Step 3 Determine the transaction price Step 4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5 Recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation Under Ind AS 115 an entity recognises revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied ie when control of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer Rendering of services In respect of contracts other than ClassEdge license and support fees revenue on timeandmaterial contracts are recognized as the related services are performed and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue Revenue from fixedprice fixedtimeframe contracts where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration is recognized as per the percentageofcompletion method Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion Projected losses if any are provided in entirety as per Ind AS based on managements current estimates of cost to completion arrived at on the basis of technical assessment of time and effort required and estimates of future expenditure Revenue from licensing of ClassEdge content to schools is recognized on a prorata basis over the contract period commensurate with the services rendered / cost incurred for the same The Group has applied the guidance in Ind AS 115 by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation The arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering equipment software licenses and support services as distinct performance obligations The performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer consumes the services as time progresses NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Revenue recognition Continued Revenue is measured based on the transaction price which is the consideration adjusted for volume discounts service level credits performance bonuses price concessions and incentives if any as specified in the contract with the customer Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers Revenues in excess of invoicing are classified as contract assets which are referred to as unbilled revenue while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities which are referred to as unearned revenues Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables only act of invoicing is pending when there is unconditional right to receive cash and only passage of time is required as per contractual terms Unearned and deferred revenue contract liability is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues Revenue from After School AFS License subscription consist of subscription fees charged for subscriptionbased online educational content Content subscription fee is received in advance and is record as deferred revenue Revenue is recognized uniformly over the contract period as the subscription services represent a obligation to provide the services while the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of such services throughout the contract period Sale of goods Revenue from sale of goods is recognised on transfer of control over to the goods to the customer Sales are recorded net of returns if any trade discounts rebates and goods and service tax Deferred contract costs are incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract Deferred contract costs are recognised as assets and amortized over the term of the customer contract except in case where the amortisation period is one year or less in which case the costs are expensed as and when incurred Interest income Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate method The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset When calculating the effective interest rate image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued K Revenue recognition Continued the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instruments for example prepayment extension but does not consider the expected credit loss Dividend income Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Groups right to receive payment is established L Leases A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration Group as a lessee The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from nonlease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the nonlease components The Group recognises rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date The cost of the rightofuse asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located The rightofuse assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation accumulated impairment losses if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability The rightofuse assets is depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of rightofuse asset The estimated useful lives of rightofuse assets are determined on the same basis as those of property plant and equipment Rightofuse assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable Impairment loss if any is recognised in the statement of profit and loss NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued L Leases Continued The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined If that rate cannot be readily determined the Company uses incremental borrowing rate For leases with reasonably similar characteristics the Company on a lease by lease basis may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole The lease payments shall include fixed payments variable lease payments residual value guarantees exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised insubstance fixed lease payments The Group recognises the amount of the remeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the rightofuse asset Where the carrying amount of the rightofuse asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in statement of profit and loss The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 to shortterm leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value The lease payments associated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term Group as a lessor At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight line basis over the lease term In case of a finance lease finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessors net investment in the lease When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and

sublease with reference to the rightofuse asset arising from the head lease not with reference to the underlying asset If a head lease is a short term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above then it classifies the sublease as an operating lease If an arrangement contains lease and nonlease components the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue to allocate the consideration in the contract The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 effective annual reporting period beginning April 1 2019 and applied the standard to its leases retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Standard recognised on the date of initial application April 1 2019 Accordingly the Company has not restated comparative information instead the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as on April 1 2019 The Group has applied the Covid 19 related concession amendment to Ind AS 116 The amendment did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in prior periods and will affect the current amp future periods only M Income Tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty if any related to income taxes It is measured using tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued M Income Tax Continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses and tax credits Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available Therefore in case of a history of recent losses the Group recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realised Deferred tax assetsunrecognised or recognised are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/ reduced to the extent that it is probable/ no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects at the reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously image

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change Acquired deferred tax benefits recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill related to that acquisition if they result from new information obtained about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero any remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain purchase gains All other acquired tax benefits realised are recognised in profit or loss N Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale if earlier When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation the comparative statement of profit and loss is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period O Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are interest and other costs including exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued P Operating Segments An operating Segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relates to transactions with any of Groups other components and for which discrete financial information is available All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess their performance Q Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares R Business combinations Business combinations under common control Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted in accordance with Pooling of Interest Method laid down by Appendix C of Indian Accounting Standard 103 Ind AS 103 Business combinations of entities under common control notified under the Companies Act 2013 All assets liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recorded in the books of account of the Group at their existing carrying amounts Intercompany balances are eliminated The difference between the investments held by the Group and all assets liabilities and reserves of the combining entity are recognised in capital reserve and presented separately from other capital reserves Comparative accounting period presented in the financial statements of the Group has been restated for the accounting impact of the merger as stated above as if the merger had occurred from the beginning of the comparative period in the financial statements Any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree is measured at fair value or as the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net identifiable assets This accounting choice is made on a transaction by transaction basis image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued R Business combinations Continued Business combinations not under common control Business combinations except under common control are accounted for using the acquisition method The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree For each business combination the Group elects whether to measure the noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred At the acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair values For this purpose the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 109 it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for noncontrolling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred then the gain is recognised NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 3 Significant accounting policies Continued R Business combinations Continued in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve However if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve without routing the same through OCI If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete Those provisional amounts are adjusted through goodwill during the measurement period or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that if known would have affected the amounts recognised at that date These adjustments are called as measurement period adjustments The measurement period does not exceed one year from the acquisition date After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the Groups cashgenerating units that

Currency Indian rupees in lakhs 44 Financial instruments Continued B Measurement of fair values The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value grouped into Level 1 to Level 3 as described below Quoted prices in an active market Level 1 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares Valuation techniques with observable inputs Level 2 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices This level of hierarchy includes derivative contracts Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data This level of hierarchy includes investments in unquoted equity shares and preference shares C Valuation technique to determine fair value The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments i Financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables loans measured at amortised cost trade and other payables borrowings other financial assets and other financial liabilities are stated at carrying value because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of the fair values due to their predominant short term nature ii Investments in quoted equity shares carried at fair value are based on market price quotations as on 31 March Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading image Eightieth Annual Report Tata Industries Limited NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024 Currency Indian rupees in lakhs 44 Financial instruments Continued C Valuation technique to determine fair value Continued Instead they are held for medium or long term strategic purpose Upon the application of Ind AS 109 the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments at FVOCI as the directors believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long term strategic investments than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss iii Investments in unquoted shares carried at fair value are based on discounted cash flow approach The valuation model considers the present value of expected cash inflows discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate iv Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments However there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique v There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the year ended March 31 2024 and March 31 2023 45 Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following
