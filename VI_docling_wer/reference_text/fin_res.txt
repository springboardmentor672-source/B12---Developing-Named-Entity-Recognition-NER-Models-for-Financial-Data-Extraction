Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited
Report on the audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Results
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated annual financial results of Tata Consultancy Services
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its
subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2025, attached herewith,
being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities
and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended ("Listing Regulations").
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the
aforesaid consolidated annual financial results:
a. include the annual financial results of the entities mentioned in Annexure I;
b. are presented in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations in this
regard; and
c. give a true and fair view in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in
the applicable Indian Accounting Standards, and other accounting principles generally accepted in
India, of consolidated net profit and other comprehensive income and other financial information of
the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Results section of our
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe
that the audit evidence obtained by us, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on
the consolidated annual financial results.
Management’s and Board of Directors’/Trustees' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Annual
Financial Results
These consolidated annual financial results have been prepared on the basis of the consolidated annual
financial statements.
The Holding Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and
presentation of these consolidated annual financial results that give a true and fair view of the consolidated
net profit/ loss and other comprehensive income and other financial information of the Group in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards
prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations.
The respective Management and Board of Directors/Trustees of the companies/entities included in the
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions
B S R & Co. LLP
Independent Auditor’s Report (Continued)
Tata Consultancy Services Limited

of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of each company/entity and for preventing and detecting frauds
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated
annual financial results that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated annual
financial results by the Management and the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated annual financial results, the respective Management and the Board of
Directors of the companies/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for assessing
the ability of each company/entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of
Directors/Trustees either intends to liquidate the company/entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies/ Trustees of the entities included in the Group is
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company/entity.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Results
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual financial results
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated annual financial results.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
– Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual financial results,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion through a separate report on the complete set of financial statements on
whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures in the consolidated annual financial results made by the
Management and Board of Directors.
– Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management’s and Board of Directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual financial
results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated annual financial results,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated annual financial results represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited
Report on the audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone annual financial results of Tata Consultancy Services
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2025, attached herewith,
being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended ("Listing Regulations").
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the
aforesaid standalone annual financial results:
a. are presented in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations in this
regard; and
b. give a true and fair view in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in
the applicable Indian Accounting Standards, and other accounting principles generally accepted in
India, of the net profit and other comprehensive income and other financial information for the year
ended 31 March 2025.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results section of our
report. We are independent of the Company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion on the standalone annual financial results.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Annual Financial
Results
These standalone annual financial results have been prepared on the basis of the standalone annual
financial statements.
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and
presentation of these standalone annual financial results that give a true and fair view of the net profit/
loss and other comprehensive income and other financial information in accordance with the recognition
and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of
the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33
of the Listing Regulations. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records
in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively
for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and

presentation of the standalone annual financial results that give a true and fair view and are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone annual financial results, the Management and the Board of Directors are
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of
Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative
but to do so.
The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone annual financial results
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these standalone annual financial results.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
– Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone annual financial results,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible
for expressing our opinion through a separate report on the complete set of financial statements on
whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone annual financial results made by the Management
and Board of Directors.
– Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management’s and Board of Directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone annual financial
results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone annual financial results,
including the disclosures, and whether the standalone annual financial results represent the
