Generalizable Facial Presentation Attack Detection Based on the Analysis 
of Facial Regions(2023) 
 
ABSTRACT  
Advancements in deep learning have significantly improved presentation attack detection 
(PAD) systems, achieving high accuracy across various realistic conditions. However, most 
existing methods rely on analyzing the entire face, overlooking the fact that artefacts used in 
spoofing attacks can appear in different facial regions depending on the type of attack 
instrument, the individual subject, and environmental factors. Moreover, these systems often 
struggle to correctly identify genuine users who unintentionally occlude parts of their face with 
accessories like glasses, scarves, or masks, especially in health-related scenarios. This work 
addresses these limitations by investigating the effectiveness of individual facial regions for 
PAD. A novel metric called Face Region Utility is introduced to evaluate how well a specific 
facial region can detect attacks when trained on a different region. Extensive testing on standard 
PAD databases under challenging conditions reveals that certain regions can effectively replace 
full-face analysis. Notably, the proposed approach improves detection performance by up to 
67.73% when genuine users wear protective masks, demonstrating its potential to enhance PAD 
reliability in real-world situations.
